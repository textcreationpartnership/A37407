            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Tho' this undertaking does ſeem to be of a greater extent, and to require a larger Bulk, than theſe ſheets will admit off; yet I queſtion not, to give a full and ſatisfactory account of the Policy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and therein of the fundamental Maxims of their Government: Of the ſtrength and numbers of their <hi>Militia,</hi> of the Civil Offices and their Revenues, with a Relation of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and all thereunto belonging, adding the Model and Conſtitution of their Religion, with the Articles of their Faith, and the <hi>Memoires</hi> and Hiſtory of the preſent <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Life unto this day. if I perform this ſo well, as to content the Curioſity and Speculation of the Age upon thoſe points, I ſhall have ſufficiently flattered my Ambition in having been able to furniſh any thing towards the publick ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

This ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the <hi>Turkiſh Machiavels</hi> look upon to have been a main Engin to the Encreaſe and Enlargement of their Dominions, and fancy the ſlackning this Diſcipline, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals in the Miniſtry under ſome of the late Emperours, has been the occaſion of thoſe Revolts and Diſorders which have happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that State.</p>
               <p>The next is, the Princes preferring ſuch Perſons to the principal Charges of the Court and Empire, as <hi>he can advance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Envy, and deſtroy without Peril:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing could be more for the intereſt of a Prince than the conduct of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court in this point; for none are admitted into the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Service, but ſuch as have had their Breeding and Education from him, and by that means have imbibed ſuch Principles from their Infancy as tend wholly to the real Thankfulneſs for the Bread and Nouriſhment they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and a kind of Religious Awe and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to his Perſon. Beſides, as theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Perſons are conſtantly ſuch as are taken in War or by Pyracy from <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Parents they remain without thoſe uſual ſupport
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56668:4"/>which the common Intereſt of a Family and Alliances does afford. Moreover, the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they inſpire into thoſe Perſons are ſuch as nouriſh and foment a deteſtation and abhorrence of their Parents Opinions, and ſpurr them on to the venturing their lives, their All to reduce them to the ſame Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Parity</hi> of Perſons which is obſerved throughout All the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, is alſo without queſtion one of the main ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſway, for all are here equal and nothing but merit does advance People to the Miniſtry and places of State. Thus all Offices being in the immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſal of the Emperour, and not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Factions of Grandees, who might divert the Peoples Eyes from off the Court, and by degrees tempt and delude themſelves into Rebellion, they make their addreſſes directly to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> as to the true ſource of their Promotions and Fortunes. And as this <hi>Parity</hi> makes all the People court only their Princes favour, ſo it prevents any thoughts of an Inſurrection, or off caſting of that Yoke of Tyranny, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning baſely to follow and promote the Intereſt of thoſe who are but their Equalls. Thus the Subjects in <hi>Turky</hi> have nothing Hereditary, all their Honours and Places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56668:5"/>with their lives, none receiving any Glory from Illuſtriouſneſs of extraction, but only from the Princes Favour and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is in no wiſe claim'd or leſſen'd by greatneſs of Birth, which here rather creates jealouſy and danger, than favour and advantage: By theſe means People are Studious to qualify themſelves for Offices, which Perſonal Merits render them Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for; and as the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> is here the Adminiſtratour to all dead Men's Eſtates, Parents have not their thoughts ſo intent of heaping up Riches for an Inheritance to their Children, as they are to Capacitate them for their Princes Service. And this Deſtruction of all Nobility, cutting off all ſucceſſion to Riches, Offices and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but in the direct <hi>Ottomen</hi> line, does certainly preſerve the Body of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire free from Faction and Rebellion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Rich and powerful Governments of many Provinces which lye far remote from the Seat of the Empire, might tempt their Governours to a Rebellion, had they the aſſiſtance and ſupport which an ancient and an Illuſtrious Extraction does afford. But as their <hi>Baſhaws</hi> come of unknown Parents, are continued but for a ſhort time in thoſe forreign Governments, are Strangers in the Countries they ſway, have no ancient Blood
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56668:5"/>and Eſtates to entitle them Heirs to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, no Relations, Kindred or Alliances to ſecond, proſecute or revenge their Quarrels, or to create Kindneſs or Compaſſion in the People to concern themſelves in their behalf; ſo are theſe Miniſters deprived of all means, opportunities or poſſibility, of promoting any Intereſt of their own above that of their Soveraigns: this it is has rendred all Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been, and ſometimes will be in all Empires of ſuch ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as <hi>Turky;</hi> this it is that ſuffers the greateſt Subjects in thoſe Dominions to be cut off according to the Princes Caprice, without raiſing the leaſt Murmurs amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who gaze upon ſuch Spectacles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concern, or if they Create any Motions in them they are only ſuch as afford pleaſure, which they receive in ſeeing ſuch Examples of Fortunes Unconſtancy in the World. But this ſeverity in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Policy does not only extend to the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> and great Men, but to the very <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family it ſelf, who are ſuppreſſed with greater ſtrictneſs than all others, and are debarred all Wealth and Offices. Thus by the fundamental Laws of the Empire, the Children of a <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Daughter married to a <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> are not capable of any Office in the State, but if by favour this is at any time diſpenſed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56668:6"/>with, they can never attain to any higher Preferment than that of a <hi>Capugibaſhee,</hi> which is one of the Porters of the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Gate. Nay, it is ſo great a Crime to be allyed to the Royal Family, that it is almoſt Treaſon in thoſe of this Race to name it, nor is there in <hi>Turky</hi> but one Branch of this Line of any account or eſteem, and that is the Offſpring of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> who was a Son of the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Siſter, and marryed to a <hi>Sultana</hi> (and are ſaid to be of the Race of the <hi>Tartars</hi>) thus coming only by the Womans ſide the leſs notice is taken of their Blood. Nor had this Family ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to this day, had it not been for this extraordinary Prudence and Diſcretion of its conduct in all the Revolutions of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Government, never aſpiring to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor medling with affaires of State, but living contentedly and with out Oſtentation upon a ſmall yearly revenue of about 70000 Dollars.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> do look upon as one Cauſe of the Conſervation of their Dominions, their laying waſt and deſolating their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces that lye the fartheſt remote from the Seat of their Empire, and by this means they think to enervate and diſpirit the People, and bring them more within the reach and compaſs of Authority. And indeed it is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56668:6"/>ſeldom known that any Rebellions do ariſe under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſway, tho' in the remoteſt parts of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and theſe few that have been ſeen, have with caſe been calmed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for the Male-contents and reſtleſs Spirits find no ſhelter in thoſe Parts, being ſtripped of their Fortifications and Retreats in the Woods and Forreſts, and the Rebels thereby expoſed to the purſuits of an irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Prince. And this it is that conſtrains the great men of that Empire to deliver themſelves up without more ado to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Puniſhment and Death at the Will of their Soveraign, ſeeing they have no means of flight, nor no place of refuge leſt in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that are laid wholly waſt and afford no ſuſtenance or ſupport. Beſides this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling, diſmantling, and thus deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Country, is attended with this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage, that no Forreign Enemy can with a Land Army make any Invaſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it with advantage, for the deſolation of it renders it uncapable of furniſhing any Proviſions, and that there it is eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and for an Army to bring Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Proviſion along with it ſufficient for ſuch an Expedition, is a thing almoſt impoſſible. Nevertheleſs the immediate Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Places of their new Conqueſts the <hi>Turks</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56668:7"/>take always Care to fortify, and to garniſh and ſtrengthen with Colonies of their own People.</p>
               <p>Now as the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Expeditions are like a Torrent, which bears all down before them ſo it is a point of their Policy when they have made a Conqueſt of any conſiderable Country to ſtrike up a Peace immediately, that ſo they may have time to ſettle and confirm themſelves in their new Acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, well knowing, that what they have ſo haſtily overrun, is again to be as eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and that the ſtream of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations is as rapid in the Ebb as in the Flux.</p>
               <p>The frequent Change of Officers, the degrading of ſome and exalting of others, is thought to tend very much to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, for hereby thoſe Sparks are deprived of the means of rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves in the Peoples Affections, or of fomenting any mutiny or alteration in the State: Beſides as all Offices are here purchaſed at very dear Rates, every <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Grand Caire</hi> or of <hi>Babylon</hi> paying three or four hundred thouſand Dollars for their Commiſſion; others two, others one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand, according as their places are more or leſs conſiderable, and this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they are conſtrained to take up at inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56668:7"/>paying forty or fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> annually and oftentimes more, ſo that they are forced to ſqueeze and fleece the People for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſing themſelves again, clear their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and bribe and purchaſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Protection of the Minions of the Court. Nevertheleſs this ſtands them in little ſtead, for when they have pretty well glutted themſelves with their Exorbitant Exactions, and that the People begin to bawle out loud againſt the Tyranny and Oppreſſion of thoſe Miniſters, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently offered up a Sacrifice to their Furies, and thoſe vaſt Eſtates and Maſs of Treaſure which they had ſo unjuſtly heaped, confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> uſe, who only beſtows on their Poſterity what he in his Bounty thinks fitting. Nor are theſe <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi> of Miniſters the only Perſons liable to the ſeverity of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Government, thoſe who are the Favourites of the People being no leſs expoſed to the keenneſs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> ſway, which looks upon Popularity as an unpardonable Crime. But then theſe Darling Officers are not diſpatched into the other World after the ſame manner as thoſe publick Peſts, who are executed in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, but the others are cajoled with all manner of fair treatment, the <hi>Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> Umbrage is diſſembled and they perhaps
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56668:8"/>preſented with a Horſe, a Sword, a Sable Veſt, or a Commiſſion for ſome more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and advantagious Government, until they have got them into ſuch places, that the Executioner doing his orders by ſlipping the Bow-ſtring about their Necks, cannot create any combuſtion nor hazard the publick Peace. Thus does <hi>Turky</hi> afford the fruitful Landskip of the unconſtancy and mutability of Humane Grandeur that ever any other Country did, one moment ſeeing one of theſe Meteors ſhining in all the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, pomp, luſtre and magnificence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and the next fall unpittied, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly put to death, his body thrown into the Dirt of a forreign and unknown Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, without any ſolemnity of Funeral or Monument, but no ſooner in the Grave than his memory is forgotten.</p>
               <p>But now I think 'twould not be all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improper to ſet down ſome of thoſe Religious Arts and Maximes whereby the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Faith has and is propogated, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince their Law has that influence upon Affairs of State, and ſo contrived for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profit of the Sovereign; but for that purpoſe I ſhall not need to look back ſo far as to give an account of its firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king root or eſtabliſhment, nor that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> Law was an hodge-podg of <hi>Judaiſme,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56668:8"/>Chryſtianity,</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> nor of his nicking for lucky a juncture, as when the greateſt Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians of the Age were employed in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Model of an Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy, they and the Divines buſied in healing the Wounds, which the Hereſies of <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius</hi> had made in the Church, nor ſhall I ſpeak of the ſtupidity and blockiſhneſs of the Age and Country he firſt ſet up in, and ſo the more eaſy to be impoſed upon by his falſe and pretended Miracles, giving out he was ſent by God to give a new Law to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and that he was to reduce the World by force of Arms to his Obedience; that as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was greater than <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo was he greater than <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the laſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; that he had Communication with the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> for two years together that he lived in a Cave, who delivered to him and helped him to compile the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> tho' it was done by the help of <hi>Sergius</hi> the <hi>Monk;</hi> keeping a Pidgeon which he had taught to feed out of his Ear, he pretended it was the Holy Ghoſt, whom he converſed with and who inſtructed him in the Divine Precepts. Whenever he was in fits of the Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to which he was extreamly ſubject, he gave out that they were holy and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Trances, with many other ſuch like fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, and mad-viſionary tales, too tedious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56668:9"/>here to relate. Wherefore we will only take a ſhort view of the practices now in uſe with them for the inſinuating and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Rites, Doctrines and Laws of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>The firſt was a Toleration of other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, eſpecially cajoling the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and their Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ents, owning <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a Prophet, and a greater too than <hi>Moſes;</hi> that <hi>Mary</hi> conceived by the ſmell of a Roſe; that the bleſſed Virgin was free from Original ſin, and the Temptations of the Devil; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Word of God and is ſo ſtiled in the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and cured Diſeaſes, raiſed the dead, and workt many miracles, and that his Diſciples did the like by his power, hardly any of them ever ſpeaking of our Saviour but with Veneration and Reverence, but will warmly deny his Paſſion, ſaying it were an Impiety to believe that God who loved and had conferred ſo much Power, and ſo many Graces on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould ſo far diſhonour him, as to deliver him into the Hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were the worſt and moſt ſcorned of Men, or to the Death of the Croſs which was the moſt vile and infamous of all puniſhments; for being, as they ſay, led toward the place of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God not permitting ſo baſe a People to put to Death ſo holy a Prophet (for they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56668:9"/>confeſs that he never ſinned) did aſſume him into Heaven: when miſt and ſought by the Souldiers in the throng, they laid hold of one of the Judges that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, who reſembled him much in favour and proportion, telling him that he ſhould not eſcape from them again; and ſo not believing whatſoever he ſaid, executed him in his Room. By ſuch like Baits and Artifices as theſe, and puniſhing ſeverely all thoſe who Blaſpheme the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they think to decoy and invite over to their belief the unwary Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Toleration, as I ſaid, being one of the firſt Traps that was laid for the Profeſſours of others Creeds, they have improved it to this, among the other advantages of ſeducing and perverting the People that dwell among them, that as they allow of Churches and Houſes of Devotion in places where they have been anciently founded, but admit not of holy buildings on new Foundations; they may repair the old coverings and roofs, but cannot lay a ſtone in a new Place conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Divine Service, nor if fire or any accident deſtroy the ſuperſtructure can it be re-edifyed, or any new ſtrength added to the Foundation, wherewith to underprop for an other building. Thus in time all the Churches in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire muſt of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56668:10"/>neceſſity fall to utter ruine, as many have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, ſo that ſeeing the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Laws do not permit <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in time will be aboliſhed in thoſe Dominions, unleſs it be the good Will of Heaven otherwiſe to ordain it.</p>
               <p>Neither are their Laws concerning <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Children leſs conducing to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Chriſtianity, for if a man turn <hi>Turk,</hi> his Children under the age of fourteen years, tho' educated with other Principles, muſt be forced to the ſame Perſwaſion, Men that ſpeak againſt the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, that have raſhly promiſed at a time of Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Drunkenneſs to become <hi>Turks,</hi> orhave had a carnal knowledge of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, muſt either become Martyrs or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; beſides many other ſubtleties they have to entrap the Souls of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with the niceties and entanglements of their Law.</p>
               <p>Another point of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Policy is for the promoting of their Sect, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up any City Town or Fortreſs where <hi>Moſques</hi> or other Religious Houſes of their perſwaſion have been once built, and where <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> has been profeſſed; thus the <hi>Turk</hi> has no ſooner ſet footing in a Town, but that he falls immediately to erecting of <hi>Moſques</hi> and Temples, and thereby lays an
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56668:10"/>obligation upon the conſciences of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to make the moſt obſtinate and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Defence, and this being a Principle of their Religion never to yield upon a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſurrender, it has often been ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and ſpirited the Defendants to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that all the terrours and miſeries of Famine, Sword, and other Calamities have not been capable to conſtrain them to lay down their Arms and capitulate a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Artifices the <hi>Mahametan</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it ſelf had ſuch Baits and Decoys, as were ſure to catch and trepan all Carnal and Voluptuous Men, <hi>Mahomet</hi> promiſing to the Poſſeſſours of the World, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Palaces ſpread all over with ſilk Carpets, flowry Fields and Chriſtalline Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; Trees of Gold ſtill flouriſhing; ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſing the Eye with their goodly Forms, and the Taſte with their Fruits, under whoſe fragrant ſhades they ſhall ſpend the courſe of their happy time with Amorous Virgins, who ſhall alone regard their particular lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Not ſuch as have lived in this World, but created on purpoſe: with great black Eyes, beautiful as a Hyacinth, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of one act of Carnal Copulation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>THe <hi>Turks</hi> are generally well complexio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, of goodly Statures, full Bodies, and ſutably proportioned; they ſuffer no hair about them, but a lock on their Crown, and what grows on their Faces; for their Beards they wear at full length, as a mark of gravity and of freedom, the Slaves in the <hi>Levant</hi> being ſhaved, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed who ſo un-man themſelves by taking off their Beards. It is a badge of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to wear white Shaſhes and Turbants on their Heads, and they diſtinguiſh their Vocations and Quality by their foldings and their ſize. Next to their Skin they wear a Calico Smock, with large Sleeves longer than their Arms; under this a pair of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico Drawers, reaching to their Anckles, with Yellow or Red ſlip-Shoes, picked at the Toe, and plated on the Soal: Over all they wear a half ſleeved Coat girt unto them with a Shaſh or Towel: their Neck all bare; and this is their Summer Garb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Doors. But when they go abroad they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56668:13"/>wear over all Gownes, ſome with wide half Sleeves, others with long hanging Sleeves buttoned before, and by the meaner People another Faſhion, reaching but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Knee, with hanging-Sleeves not much longer than the Arm, and open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but all of them ungathered in the Shoulders. In the Winter they wear a kind of Breeches or Drawers of Cloth which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſmall of their Leg are ſowed to ſhort ſmooth Buskins of Leather without Soals, fit for the Foot, as the Glove for the Hand; lining their Gowns with Fur, as they do their Coats; having then the Sleeves (or quilted Waſtecotes under them) reaching cloſe to their Wriſts. They wear no Gloves, they wear long Handkerchiefs at their Girdles, ſome of great Value, and admirable well wrought, the Modes never change in <hi>Turky,</hi> no more than they do in <hi>Spain,</hi> nor is there any great difference in the make of the Cloaths of mean People and thoſe of Quality, only that they wear Cloth of Tiſſue, of Gold and Silver, Velvet, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Satin, Damask, Camlets, lined with Sables and other coſtly Furres, and with Martins, Squirrils, Foxes, and Coney-skins according to their ſeveral Qualities. But the common wear is Violet Cloth, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtill the Antient cuſtome of preſenting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56668:14"/>Change of Rayment. The Clergy go much in Green, it being <hi>Mahomets</hi> Colour, and thoſe of his Poſterity and Kindred wear Green ſhaſhes, and are called <hi>Emers,</hi> which is Lord, the Women in like manner wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo ſomething of Green upon their Heads to be known. A <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to wear Green, if he does out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, he ſhall be ſoundly beaten, and his Cloaths torn off his Back. In the City they have no Arms, only tuck under their Girdle a crooked Knife of the bigneſs of a Dagger, in ſheaths of Mettal, all beſet with Gemms and precious Stones to a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value. They are upright in their Gate, lofty in their Demeanour with an elated Countenance. The greateſt ſign of Love and Honour is among them to take a Perſon by the Hand, and lay it to ones Forehead; they lay their Hands on their Boſomes in their familiar Salutations, bending their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a little; but in their reſpects to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Illuſtrious Quality, they bow to the very Ground, and kiſs the Hem of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Ornaments of their Head, they never put off upon any occaſion, they are Devout obſervers of cleanlineſs and neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not only waſhing all parts of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies upon every ſlight, occaſion, but going into their <hi>Bannio's</hi> (which are the moſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56668:14"/>of their Publick Buildings) once or twice a Week, but perfuming their Beards and the inſide of their Turbants with Amber, they are ſo ſuperſtitious in their waſhings, that they fancy the leaſt Excrement upon their Garments is a Polution. They ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom travel ſingle, but expecting till a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number be bound for the ſame place, go and lodg together; Theſe are called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans,</hi> and are ſecurity from Thieves unleſs they come in Troops, and then the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſends againſt them, they have not many Occupations and Exerciſes, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally extream ſlothful, their Minds being in no wiſe inclined to Arts, nor have they any Inclination for the Sciences, ſo that it's no wonder if a Man can only be provided in their Country with what is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Life, indiſpenſably uſeful to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and very meanly proper for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of the Mind and Body, and for the paſſing ones time pleaſantly and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But only ſuch as make it their Profeſſion, and gain thereby their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood. Cards and Dice they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, but will play at cheſs all the day long, an amuzement ſuting well enough with their ſedentary Humour. Thoſe of the better rank delight much in Horſes, which are both beautiful and well managed, but cannot undergo hard riding; their Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, tho' not large be hard and deep, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted behind and before, and ſome of them with Silver, as are their Maſſie Stirrups, and the Reins of their Bridles ſuited unto their other coſtly Capariſons. When they ſtand in the Stable, they feed them for the moſt part, if not altogether with Barley; being here of ſmall Value, and only ſerving for that purpoſe; they litter them in their own Dung, firſt dryed in the Sun, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verated, which keeps their Skins clean, ſmooth and ſhining.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Turky</hi> they ſhut Cats and Dogs out of Doors every Night, and this is made a piece of their Religion, and a cleanly one: the Dogs go moſt together making a hideous noiſe

None but Publick Buildings as are the <hi>Temples, Baths, Hoſpitals, Coravanſerats, Baſarts</hi> and <hi>Beſeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins,</hi> that have any thing in any wiſe paſſable well contrived. Nevertheleſs the roofs of many of their Private Houſes are curiouſly fieled with inlaid Wood adorned with Gold and Azure to an exceſſive coſtlineſs, the upper end of the Room being a little raiſed, is covered with <hi>Turky</hi> Carpets, whereon when they tread they put off their Slip-ſhoes. In the heat of the day they ſit on great out-Windows which many of them have made for that purpoſe. But as for Hangings or the like to their Rooms they have none, all their Furniture on the Inſide being only bare White Walls, unleſs ſome peculiar Room in the Houſes of thoſe of the Higheſt Quality.</p>
               <p>Their Publick Buildings are vaſt, and ſtately afar off being wonderfully beautifyed by the abundance of Trees planted among the Houſes, ſo as each City ſeems rather a Wood than a City; which, beſide the pleaſant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſhelters againſt the Summer Sun and Winters Wind; the Streets are not broad, but paved with a high foot-Cauſay on each ſide, in the middle a paſſage for Carts and Horſes; from the Caves on both ſides is made a Boarded Arch not very cloſe, yet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56668:17"/>much defenſive againſt Sun and Rain. <hi>Turky</hi> is furniſhed with magnificent Bridges, as Hanes, Mesketoes, High-ways and other publick Structures; and by this means, when any Provincial Governour is both for Riches and Rapin notorious, he is ſure ere long to be circumvented, or elſe laid open to the Accuſer for confiscation, he to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this hath no fairer way, than for the publick good to make ſome work of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent magnificence; wherein lie the two ſafe points of Reputation, in being held pious and exhauſt, the one ſtops the Accuſer, the other the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>But as I have ſpoke ſomething of their Diet and their Habitations, it will not be impertinent to enlarge a little farther upon their Houſe-keepings and Habitations; the <hi>Turks</hi> find the advantage of their ſparing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour both in War and at home, the greateſt Proviſions that are carryed into their Camp being only of Rice, potted Butter, and ſome dry or poudred Meats, they do not buſy a vaſt number of Men to ſearch after and procure a hundred ſorts of different Meats, nor oblige their Souldiers to wander from their main Body to fetch away to the peril of their lives wherewith to ſatisfy their Intemperance. And as for their Houſe keeping a Barrel of Rice a year, with ſome Pots of Butter, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56668:17"/>dryed Fruits, make the greateſt <hi>Proviſions</hi> of a very numerous Family. For my part I can refer to no other Cauſe than this the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety the ſtrength and plumpneſs of all the Eaſtern-People: And if they were allowed to have great Eſtates in Property for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Annual Rents, this Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Moderation they have ſo long made in their Diet, would have ſetled more Rich Families in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> than Feaſting and Luxury have ruined in all his Majeſties three Kingdomes. For a Kitchin in a Houſe is like the Spleen in the Body, the more it Augments, the more the other Faculties di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh. Nevertheleſs their <hi>Pillaw, Doulma, Boureck, Chorbes</hi> and other Dainties would be pleaſing enough to ſome of our niceſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats in <hi>Europe,</hi> and whereon a Man might make both a ſubſtantiall and a delicious meal.</p>
               <p>Their Attendants at the Table are Slaves, ſuch as have been beſtowed upon them by way of Preſent, or which they have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in War or by their Money; and the greater number a Man has, the richer he is accounted: They make three Meals a day. But at a Feaſt they beſiege the Table all the day long, unleſs they riſe to eaſe Nature and forthwith return. They abominate Hogs-Fleſh, Blood, and whatever hath dyed of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56668:18"/>it ſelf, unleſs in extream neceſſity. As Wine is prohibited them by their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> (wherein nevertheleſs they will debauch to a high Degree in private) their uſual Drink is pure Water and ſundry ſorts of <hi>Sherbets,</hi> ſome made of Sugar and Lemmons, ſome of Violets, Peaches, Apricocks, or other Flowers, Fruits or Plumbs, as is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of each Province; theſe are dryed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a conſiſtence reaſonable hard, and portable for their uſe in War, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, mingling about a ſpoonful with a Quart of Water. But one of their moſt common Drinks, now in great requeſt with us, is their <hi>Coffee,</hi> and Coffee-Houſes abound in <hi>Turky</hi> more than Taverns nay Inns or Ale-Houſes in <hi>England.</hi> In their <hi>Coffee-Houſes</hi> upon Scaffolds half a yard High, which they call <hi>Sofats,</hi> covered with Mats, they ſit croſs-leg'd after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner, commonly two or three hundred together chatting, often having ſome ſorry Muſick, thrumming up and down the Room all the while. They are incredible takers of <hi>Opium,</hi> which abounds in ſome of their Provinces, this they ſay expelleth all fear and renders them Couragious, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wild-headed, and occaſioning turbulent Dreams. The <hi>Turks</hi> are exceſſive in their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, ſurpaſſing therein all other Nations
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56668:18"/>which is to be aſcribed to Polygamy, which renders the Husband unfit for ſufficient cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and ſuſpicious the Women will ſeek for due Benevolence elſewhere. Now they are generally exhorted to Matrimony for the propagating of their Law, and the Man loſes his Reputation who deferreth marrying till the Age of five and twenty. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man is allowed four Wives, who muſt all pin their Faith upon <hi>Mahomets</hi> Sleeves, and as many Concubines as he can keep, and that two of any Religion ſoever. Yet this ſet number of their Wives is no point of their Religion, but a reſtriction introduced upon ſome Politick Conſideration, as too great a Burden and debilitation to mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Bodies. A Man being bound to make each Wife a Cabin or Dowry, and each by the Law is allowed to claim her ſhare in the conjugal allowance, at leaſt one night in the Week; for if any of them hath been neglected for a whole Week before, ſhe may challenge <hi>Thurſday</hi> night as her due, and the Law hath provided her Remedy in that caſe againſt her Husband: But if her modeſty will not allow her to ſue for one Weeks Default, ſhe has nevertheleſs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity to contrive a ſupply of her wants. Now as the Women in <hi>Turky</hi> are kept in the higheſt reſtraint imaginable, not being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56668:19"/>allowed to ſtir abroad but muffled all but the Eyes, nor ſuffered to go to Church, or look out of the Windows of their own Houſes, nay not to converſe with their own Sons after ſuch an Age; ſo none in the World can match them in their Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contrivances for the ſatisfying their laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious Deſires, which are nouriſht and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to that Degree by the ſtrictneſs of their Guardians, that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Women are accounted the moſt immodeſt Women in the World. Nevertheleſs, a Wives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency does not here redound to the Diſgrace and Scandal of a Husband, the Brow-<hi>Antlets</hi> being placed to the account of the Father, Brother or kindred of the Woman: Her Blood and Family being thereby tainted and diſhonoured, and he by a Divorce both rids himſelf of his Wife, and purges himſelf of the diſgrace. But before we ſpeak of the formalities of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, it will not be impertinent to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t down thoſe of a Wedding. Now having bought their Wife of her Parents, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the contract before the <hi>Cadi</hi> they ſolemnize their marriage in this manner. Many Women are invited by the Mother of the Bride to accompany her the night before the Marriage day, whereof they ſpend a great part in feaſting; then lead they her
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56668:19"/>into a Bath, where they anoint and bath her. So breaking company, they depart unto their ſeveral Reſts, and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning return unto her Chamber; where they deck her in her richeſt Ornaments, tying on her Silcken Buskins with Knots not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknit. The Bridegroom having feaſted a number in like manner, in the morning they alſo repair to his Houſe in their beſt Trappings, and nobly mounted, from whence they ſet forward two and two in a Rank, to fetch home the Bride, accompanyed with Muſick, and conducted by the <hi>Sagdich,</hi> who is the neareſt of his Kindred. To the <hi>Sag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dich</hi> the Bride is delivered with her Face cloſe covered, and then ſhe is ſet aſtride on Horſe-back, with a Canopy carryed over her in ſuch manner, as no part of her is to be diſcerned. Thus does this Troup re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in the ſame order that it came, having their Preſents and Apparel carryed after them in <hi>Serbets</hi> or a kind of Baskets, and then follows the Bride her ſelf, and laſt of all her Slaves if any have been given her. The Bridegroom ſtandeth at his Door to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, and has all reſpects paid him by his Gueſts: who nevertheleſs go not in, and is regated by them with ſeveral Preſents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure. If ſhe be of Quality, ſhe is led to the Bride Chamber by an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56668:20"/>where Women ſtand prepared to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs her. But the Bridegroom himſelf muſt untie her Buskins, to which he is fain to apply his Teeth. Now he muſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Wifes with equal reſpect, giving them the ſame Diet, the ſame Apparel, and the ſame Benevolence, being expreſsly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the precepts of their Doctors, and all this muſt be exactly obſerved unleſs they are willing, and conſent to change Turns, and upon Default they may procure a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce upon complaint to the <hi>Cadi:</hi> Now they have three Degrees of Divorce, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of which is made, before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and by him both extracted and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred; the firſt ſeparates the Man and Wife only from the ſame Houſe and Bed, the Wife being ſtill allowed her Maintenance; the ſecond divides them not only in that manner, but the Husband is compelled to make good her <hi>Kabin,</hi> or Dowry promiſed at her Marriage, ſo as to have no Intereſt either in him or his Eſtate, and to be at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Freedome to Marry another, the third ſort of Divorce is called (<hi>Ouch Talac</hi>) and is made in a Solemn and more Serious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with more rigorous terms of ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in this caſe the Husband repenting of his Divorce, and deſirous to take his Wife again, cannot be admitted to her by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56668:20"/>the Law, without conſenting and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to ſee an other Man enjoy her before his Face, an injunction ordained by the Law for a puniſhment of the Husbands levity and inconſtancy. And how ſevere a Condition ſoever this may ſeem, there be ſome <hi>Turks</hi> who are content to accept of them again upon thoſe Articles, and make choice of ſome handſome Youth for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring their Wifes Bed. In ſome caſes a Woman with many of her Friends goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Cadi,</hi> where weeping and taking off her Shoe, ſhe holds the Soal upwards but ſays nothing, and this ceremony is uſed when a marryed Woman complains that her Husband would abuſe her againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And no delivery can be ſo clean and neat as this by way of Emblem, ſuch Facts being too unclean for Language; there are ſome other points pleadable in Law for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce in behalf of the Woman, as impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or frigidity in the Husband, and the like; as alſo if he maintain her not with Bread, Butter, Rice, and Flax to Spin for her cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the Law ſuppoſing her ſo good a Huſwife as to ſupply her ſelf with her own Labour; they have alſo a ſort of half Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage among them which is called <hi>Kabin,</hi> when a man takes a Wife for a Month, or for a certain limited time, and an agreement
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56668:21"/>is made for the price before the <hi>Cadee</hi> or Judge: and this is chiefly uſed by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Moreover there is ſtill an other ſort of Marriages practiſed in <hi>Turky,</hi> which is the Conjunction of an <hi>Eunuch</hi> with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; ſuch as are wholly deprived and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed of all parts of Manhood, and yet do notwithſtanding take many Wives, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Luſts of an unknown and prodigious Nature.</p>
               <p>One Priviledge the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, have more then their Soveraign, that they can marry whom they pleaſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he can marry none at all, under which reſtriction thoſe Princes have lain ever ſince the misfortune of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who being a Priſoner to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had his dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Wife <hi>Deſpina</hi> violated before his very Eyes; Inſomuch that the <hi>Sultans</hi> to prevent ſuch like Misfortunes and Diſhonours for the future, take no Female companion of their Empire, in whom they can intereſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves farther than as Slaves, or for the loſs of Goods, Riches or Eſtates. Beſides this Policy has a larger extent, for it puts off all thoſe vaſt Dowries, which otherwiſe ſhould be made anſwerable to a <hi>Sultana's</hi> Condition, ſo that by this means a great part of the Revenues of the Empire would be diverted from the true Channel of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt

               <p>The Children the <hi>Turks</hi> have by their Slaves, are equally eſteemed by them with thoſe they have by their Wives, bating this difference in eſteem of the Law, that unleſs the Father manumiſſes them by his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conferrs a lively-hood upon them by Legacy, they remain to the Charity of the Elder Brother that is born from the Wife, and are his Slaves, and he their Lord and Maſter, ſo that from the Loins of the ſame Father may proceed Children of a ſervile and ignominious Condition. The Women reſpect their Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And indeed they are generally well featured, clear, ſmooth, and ruddy complexioned, with large black Eyes, which they conſider as a Beauty, and is to be one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Charms of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Paradice, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56668:22"/>thoſe who have not naturally black Eyes, have the Art to make them ſeem ſo, and alſo dye their Eye Laſhes and Eye brows, as they alſo do the hair of their Head which they wear ſometimes diſhevell'd. Their Nails they paint with a Yellowiſh Red. On the top of their Heads they wear a Cap not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the top of a Sugar-loaf, yet a little flat of Paſte-Board, and covered with Cloth of Silver or Tiſſue.</p>
               <p>Women of the better Rank wear about the upper parts of their Armes, and ſmalls of their Leggs, Bracelets, and are elſewhere adorned with Jewels. When they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad they wear over all long Gowns of Violet or Scarlet Cloth, tyed cloſe before, the large Sleeves hanging over their Hands, having Buskins on their Leggs, and their Heads and Faces ſo mufled in fine Linnen that no more is to be ſeen of them than their Eyes, nor that of ſome, who look as through a Bevour, being forbidden by their <hi>Alchoran</hi> to diſcloſe their Beautyes unto any ſave their Fathers and their Husbands.</p>
               <p>The next that fall in our way to ſpeak of after their Wives, be their Slaves, who are Chriſtians taken in War or purchaſed with their Money. Of thoſe there are weekly Markets in each City, where they are to be ſold as Horſes in Fairs, the Men
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56668:22"/>being prized according to their faculties or Perſonal abilities, and the Women for their Youths and Beauties, being decked with all the Ornaments that can inſpire Love and Affection, and allure and invite Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And as Jockyes view and examine every Part and Limb before they ſtrike up a Bargain, ſo are they ſo ſcrutinous as to ſearch even her very Mouth. Their Maſters may lye with them, chaſtiſe them, exchange and ſell them at their Pleaſure: If any Slave become a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> he is diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Bondage. The old and the moſt deformed are put to the moſt Drudgery, the Men-Slaves may compel their Maſters before the <hi>Cady,</hi> to limit the time of their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or ſet a price of their Redemption, or elſe to ſell them unto an other; but whether of the two, they lightly refer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Slaves Election. If they be only fit for Labour, they will accept of the Time, but if skillful in any craft, of the Price, which expired or paid, they may return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Countryes. But Gally-Slaves are ſeldom releaſed, in regard of their ſmall number, and much employment which they have for them: Nor thoſe that are Slaves unto great ones, to whom the <hi>Cady's</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority extends not.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56668:23"/>
               <p>Many of the Children that the <hi>Turks</hi> do buy, they caſtrate, making all ſmooth as the back of the Hand, whereof divers do dye in cutting, who ſupply the uſes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with a Silver Quill, which they wear in their Turbants. In times paſt, they only did but geld them; but being admitted to the free Converſe of their Women, it was obſerved by ſome that they more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily delighted in their Societies. But others, that one of the <hi>Sultans</hi> ſeeing a Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cover a Mare, brought in among them that Inhumane Cuſtome. Eunuchs are in great repute with their Maſters in <hi>Turky,</hi> being intruſted with the whole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Eſtates, the Government of their Women and Houſes in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and have ſhown themſelves ſo Truſty, Loyal, Prudent and Couragious, that they have often been called to the Helm, and had the whole conduct of the State committed to their Care.</p>
               <p>As for the Trade, and Sciences of the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſome of them have ſome ſmall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and Knowledge in Philoſophy. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick they have learnt rather from neceſſity and experience than the Grounds of the Art. Aſtronomy is in great vogue with them, and there be many pretenders to it, who ſit frequently in the Streets of the City
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56668:23"/>to tell Fortunes, and are reſorted to by ſuch as are to go a Journey or undertake any affair of Moment. They have a knack in Poetry, wherein they chaunt their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue to vile Muſick, yet are they forbidden ſo to do by their Law; Citterns, Harps, and Recorders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Principal Inſtruments. But their loud Inſtruments do rather terrify than pleaſe, and charm the Ear. They neither ſtudy, nor are farther acquainted with <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi> or Logick than what meer Nature does afford. <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> they have, tho' their Writings read by none or few, as fancying none can give us the truth of the time paſt, ſince none dare write the Truth of what is preſent. Nor indeed is Printing tolerated in <hi>Turky,</hi> for the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Learning and the Preſs to have been the chief fomenters of Diviſions in <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> has prohibited them his Dominions, and makes his Subjects contented with ſuch learning as proceeds from leſs erring Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which they find adapt them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for all State-employments, and ſooner furniſhes them with clearer reaſon, than thoſe who run through a long courſe of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Terms, ſtrang Languages and muſty Arts, which the Cuſtome of their Univerſities does oblige their Students to. And indeed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56668:24"/>their Miniſtry has been found ſo expert, ſo Prudent and ſo ſagacious in all their Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations and Tranſactions, that they could never be over-reached by the moſt learned and moſt Politick Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Thus all Sciences that have any affinity to thoſe we call liberal, are taught no where ſave in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew more at large hereafter, where the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> hath power to increaſe or diminiſh the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Profeſſours according as it ſuits his Occaſions. By which conduct thoſe many Schiſms and Diſtractions which in the State of moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happen both in Church and State, are forecloſed and prevented, and thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny refined Mercurial Heads, which with us for want of employment make it their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to blow up the flames of Sedition, are ſeta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Writing they uſe, and that in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters, but leave out the Vowels unleſs it be at the end of a word, ſo that much is contained in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Room; they curiouſly ſleek their Paper which is thick, much of it being Coloured and dappelled like Chamblets, done by a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56668:24"/>trick they have of dipping it in Water. Every one hath ſome Trade or other, not ſo much as the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> excepted. Yet their Trades are ſuch as ſerve only their own Uſes and Neceſſities, and not ſuch as ſupply forreign Marts, which they do not much frequent. And tho' the <hi>Turks</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively avaricious, yet they only work by ſtarts, and more for their Amuſement and Recreation then for Profit. The <hi>Europeans</hi> have taught them to be ſubtle, nay treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in their compacts and dealings, tho' indeed it muſt be owned, they have not yet attained to the skill of their Maſters. There is no People more covetous of Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than the <hi>Turks,</hi> in meeting upon the High-way one with a ſtoop, and his Hand upon his Breaſt, bids <hi>Salaum Aleek,</hi> the other with like abeyſance, replyes <hi>Aleek Salaum:</hi> And when any one comes into Company, the reſt ſalute him with a <hi>Merrabbak Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> ever ſweetning their Converſation, with ſuch accent of Pronunciation, and ſo much reſpective geſture, as ſavours of a gentle Genius, free from that rudeneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are accuſed.</p>
               <p>After their departure this Life, the Men by the Men, and the Women by the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are laid out in the middle of the Room. Whereupon diverſe of their Prieſts do aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Then lay the Coarſe on a Beer, placing a Turbant at the upper end, and carry it to the Grave, with the Head forward: ſome of the <hi>Derviſes</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before with Tapers, the Prieſt ſinging after, and laſtly his Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But Perſons of Principal Quality have their Horſes led before them, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes trailed on the Earth, and other Rites of that Nature, divers of the <hi>Lanters</hi> going before, naming of God, and ſhaking of their Heads, and whirling about until they fall down giddy, the ſides and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of the Grave are Boarded. For they are of opinion that two terrible Angels called <hi>Mongi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and <hi>Gudequir,</hi> do preſently repair unto the Grave, and put the Soul again into the Body, as if (ſaith the <hi>Alcoran</hi>) a Man ſhould put on his Shirt and raiſing him on his Knees, with his Head uncovered, (the winding Sheet being left unknit for that purpoſe) demand of him in particular how he hath behaved himſelf in this Life. Which if not well, the one ſtrikes him on the Head
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56668:25"/>with a Hammer nine fathome into the Earth, the other tearing him with an Iron Hook; and ſo continue to torment until the day of Judgment. A Purgatory ſo feared, that in their prayers they Petition God to deliver them from the Examinations of the Black Angels, the tortures of the Grave and their evil Journey. But if he have ſatisfyed them in this reply, they vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and two white Angels come in their Places, the one laying his Arm under his Head, the other ſitting at his Feet, and ſo Protect him until Dooms day. Their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultures are notable; thoſe of Princes or great Men, are covered over with Silk, or Cloth of Gold, with a Turbant at the Head, land ſet under a vaulted Arch ſupported by four Marble Pillars; ſome with a little Cock of Fountain Water, and Lamps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually burning; they are made near the <hi>Moſquees,</hi> eſpecially if they built one, but never with in them; the more ordinary are buryed in ſome pleaſant Place without the City, with a high Stone ſtanding at the Head, and another at the Feet; that at the Head, hath ſometimes an Epitaph, and if it be a Man of Quality, is made at top in form of a <hi>Turbant;</hi> thoſe who beſtow a Marble Stone over them, have it in the middle cut through about a yard long, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56668:26"/>a Foot broad; therein they Plant ſuch a kind of Plants, or Flowers as endure Green all the Year long; which ſeem to grow out of the dead Body, thinking thereby to reduce it again into Play, tho' not in the Scene of ſenſible Creatures, yet of thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitable, which is the next degree, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a preferment beyond the Duſt. The Women flock every <hi>Thurſday</hi> in Multitudes to the Graves, weeping over their Children, Husbands, Kinsfolks and dead Progenitors, often kiſſing the Stones, and praying for their delivery from the aforeſaid Black tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; many times leaving Bread and Meat on the Graves for Dogs and Birds to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as well as to relieve the Poor, being held an available Alms for the deceaſed. The better ſort do mourn in white, and but for a little ſeaſon. And the Women are not to marry by their Law, until four Months and ten days after their Husbands death.</p>

But there was alſo a Politick motive of this Prohibition of <hi>Maohmets,</hi> who conſidered that it was impoſſible if a Nation once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an Univerſal Prudence, but that the deceitful knack of ſuch a Carnal Adoration muſt needs grow loathſome, or lye obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their reproof, that ſhall make it their full employment to find faults; and after an opportunity is eaſily gained, to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Change, by diſcovering to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abſurdities in their Worſhip; which is better prevented, in one directed as his is, to the only Inviſible and Omnipotent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, whoſe Nature and Power is ſo far remote from the weake apprehenſions of Men, as the ſharpeſt Reaſon is not able to batter a Faith ſolely built upon it. They are commanded ſeaven times a day to reſort unto Publick Prayers: the firſt aſſembling is called <hi>Singilnamas,</hi> which is two Hours before day; the ſecond <hi>Sabahnamas,</hi> at day
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56668:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>break; the third <hi>Vyle-namas</hi> at noon; the fourth <hi>Kyndinameus</hi> at three of the Clock: the fifth <hi>Akſhamnamas</hi> after Sun ſet: the ſixth <hi>Chogicnamas,</hi> two Hours within night: and the ſeventh <hi>Giuma-namas</hi> at ten of the Clock in the Night: the two laſt alſo on <hi>Fridayes</hi> obſerved by all, on the other days but by the more Religious: congregated they are by the chanting of Prieſts from the tops of Steeples; at which times lightly tho' they be in the Fields; they will ſpread the upper Garments on the Earth, and fall to their Devotions. <hi>Friday</hi> is their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, yet they ſpend but a part thereof in Devotion, the reſt in Recreations; but for that time they obſerve it ſo rigorouſly that all Perſons are exemplarily puniſhed that tranſgreſs the orders of it. Before they pray they waſh all the Organs of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nces; their Legs to their Knees, and their Arms to their Elbows: their Privities after their purging of Nature; and ſometimes all over from top to toe: for which there are Houſes of Office with Conduits belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every Principal Moſque. Where Water is wanting they do it with Duſt. At the Door of the Moſque, they put of their Shoes, and entring ſit croſs legg'd upon rows of Mats one behind another, the Poor and the Rich promiſcuouſly, the Prieſt in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56668:33"/>a Pulpit before them, not otherwiſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in Habit, but by the folding of their Turbant. When they pray they turn their Faces toward <hi>Mecca:</hi> firſt ſtanding upright; without any Motions of their Bodies, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Palms of their Hands upward; ſometimes they ſtop their Eyes and Ears, and oft pull their Heir on the ſides of their Faces; then thrice they Bow, as in their Salutations; and as often proſterating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Earth. Doing this ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times they will look back upon no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, until they come unto the Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> at which time they reverſe their Faces, firſt over the Right Shoulder, and then over the left, believing that his coming will be behind them, when they are at their Devotion, the Prieſt doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times read unto them ſome part of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran.</hi> This Book is written in <hi>Arabick</hi> Verſe, in forme of a Dialogue, between the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> and their Prophet, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to be tranſlated, which both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, and conceals Religion. All ſet Texts are obnoxious to ſeveral Expoſitions, thence grows Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo hath this Bread four different Sects of <hi>Mahometans,</hi> each interpreting it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Genius</hi> of its Nation, the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſimply, the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> ſupeſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56668:33"/>the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ingeniouſly, the <hi>Turks</hi> with moſt liberty, each nation ſcornes to yield to other in opinion, for honour ſake, eſpecially the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Perſian,</hi> who now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Deſigns of Conqueſt of each other, do after the Old Cuſtome of Princes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect their People in Religion toward the Enemy that they may be more fierce and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate againſt him.</p>
               <p>A great means as I have already ſaid, of <hi>Mohometiſmes</hi> making that Progreſs in the World, is its pleaſing Doctrine, ſuited to the depraved Inclinations of Mankind, it being ſaid in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> that when their Prophet asked the Angel concerning <hi>Venery</hi> and ſome other delicacyes of life, he told him; that God did not give Man ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, to have them fruſtrate but enjoyed, as made for the Guſt of Man, not his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein his Creatour delights not, upon this it is, and for the drawing in Luxurious Complexions, which perhaps are the greateſt part of Mankind, that the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> permits <hi>Poligamy</hi> to make a numerous People, which is the Foundation of all great Empires; and prohibits <hi>Wine,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Devil in every Grape; thereby har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening the Souldier, preventing diſorder, and facillitating publick Proviſion. The firſt being grateful to Nature is generally
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56668:34"/>received but the other is overpowred by Appetite, ſo that many more Drink than abſtain from Wine. Two other Principal points I ſhall touch upon in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion. One is <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> the other <hi>Purgatory:</hi> the firſt not meant in matter of <hi>Salvation,</hi> but of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and ſucceſs in this Life, they peremptoryly permit to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny</hi> fixt, and not avoydable by any Act of ours. And yet this opinion of fate which uſually takes Men off from all Induſtrious Care of their own ſafety, does not ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cker their Diligence in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at Sea, and other caſes. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no Hell for any but thoſe who believe not <hi>Mahomet;</hi> their own they afright with a Purgatory, which holds but tell Doomes day; it is acted in the Grave, the pain is inflicted by a bad Angel, whoſe force is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by a good one, according as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes Life was led. To ſtrengthen this good Angel, they do many Works of Charity, erecting <hi>Hanes,</hi> Hoſpitals and <hi>Mesketoes,</hi> making Bridges and High ways, and ſtoring them with Fountains and other Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encyes for the relief of Travellers.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoke ſo much of the Religion it ſelf, it is now convenient to ſay ſomething of the manner of its Exerciſe, which is this in ſhort; every <hi>Moſque</hi> has a high ſlender
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56668:34"/>Spyre Steeple adjoyning: on the outſide whereof and high, is made abound or Tower with a Door opening <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Eaſt,</hi> as the Countrye lyes towards <hi>Meccha;</hi> here the Prieſt or <hi>Muazzin</hi> entring, with his Hands bowed over his Ears walking round, turning on the Right Hand, in a loud voice tells the People, many times over that there is but one God, which having performed, all thoſe that are piouſly given, throng to the <hi>Moſque,</hi> and ſay their Prayers, continually repeating <hi>Allah heeber,</hi> as alſo the profeſſion of their Faith, and then they ſay <hi>Ahia Elfela, Ahia Elfela,</hi> which ſignifies come away to prayers, I give you fair notice. Their geſtures are firſt ſitting croſs legg'd, wafting of the Body, then proſtrate twice on their Face, they kiſs the Earth; afterward they riſe, and ſtand with their Hand bowed over their Ears, but never do they kneel or uncover their Head, accounting thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures unſeeming. Having already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned how often this ſervice is performed, It is fitting that I inſert, that they believe that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not having obeyed the Command they had received from God, of praying to him often, he ordered <hi>Mahomet</hi> to preſcribe to the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56668:35"/>that they ſhould addreſs to him fifty times a day their Vows and Prayers, but he foreſeeing that his followers could not well acquit themſelves of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he prevailed ſo far with God that he contented himſelf with the tenth part of the Homages, that he meant to have had paid him, and that this great number of fifty prayers a day, was reduced to five, now the laſt and firſt Service which is at day break and an Hour after Sunſet makes a fine Show, all the <hi>Moſques</hi> being hung full of burning Lamps; but none are bound to this frequency of prayer, but ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as have leiſure, others making the High-way or their Houſes ſerve the turn, and this was deviſed to keep Religion from falling into the danger of oblivion, which is in no wiſe better maintain'd than by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often called to mind. Their Sabbath is kept on the <hi>Friday,</hi> tho' not obſerved with all the ſtrictneſs that <hi>Sundays</hi> are or ought to be amongſt us. Moreover they have two ſolemn times: <hi>Bairam</hi> and <hi>Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi> they are both Lents, the firſt laſts three days, the other a month: their Faſt is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> manner, not in quantity or quality of Meats, but in time; for all the day long, they may neither eat, drink, nor uſe any ſort of venery; but at
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56668:35"/>the appearance of the firſt Star, thay make reprizals, gorging themſelves in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gluttony and Luſt. Beſides the <hi>Turks</hi> have one piece of Divinity peculiar to themſelves, which is a Cuſtome of their Prieſts to ſell their merit; ſome more, ſome leſs, according to the Sanctimony of the Seller. But before I cloſe up this Article of Religion, I will ſet down what things a <hi>Turk</hi> is bound to do before prayers, which may be reduced to five. The firſt, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Articles of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Faith. The ſecond, to be Circumcized. The third, to pardon ones Enemyes. The fourth, is to call out at the Turret of the Church Steeples, or to go to the Moſque when one is called thither. And the fifth, is to waſh ones ſelf, which is the immediate Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prayer. Now all the Articles of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Faith may be reduced to two, namely that there is one God, and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his Prophet or meſſenger, and that that only God is the Creatour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of Earth, and abſolute Maſter of all things. For which reaſon they do not ſuffer in their <hi>Moſques</hi> any Image repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any living thing, either in relief or meer painting. The ſecond Article of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Faith comprehends an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the mad fancyes and extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56668:36"/>of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and of all its Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatours, believing that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is the Meſſenger of God, and that there cannot be a more certain truth, than all that this Impoſtour has left them either in Writing or Tradition. This Article being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all the reſt, it is not neceſſary that I hear inſert all their ſilly fancies of the Creation of the World, of its Preſervation, and of the courſe God takes to ſanctify and ſave it; nor ſhall I ſpeak of all their whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſycal Opinions and ſo little conformable to right reaſon with which they fill their Minds and ſtuff their Books. Enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready has been ſaid of their Paradice which they make all Spiritual by the beatifick Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, and all brutal by a glut of all ſenſual pleaſures, and their affording Roome there to ſeveral Brute Animals. Nor ſhall I ſo much as touch upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom they admit into the Liſt of their Prophets, the number being too great, and who may all be reduced to theſe three, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whoſe Divine Filiation and Death upon the Croſs they deny, and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whom they believe to be the greateſt of all. But will fall to give ſome account of their Circumciſion, and their manner of performing it. Being often hindred by a <hi>Phimoſis</hi> from ſatisfying his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56668:36"/>Brutalities, had his fore skin cut, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that all his followers ſhould cauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be circumciſed, that ſo the Bodyes of his <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> might again be known that were killed in the Battells, they ſhould fight for the eſtabliſhment of his Law, that ſo they might be interred and Honoured as Martyres, whether it was for the more drawing in the <hi>Jews</hi> to follow his errours by the reſemblance of that Ceremony, which only differs from theirs in that having cut the fore skin, they do not tear like them, with the Naile a little of the Fleſh, which is above what the <hi>Anotamiſts</hi> call the Curb, whether in ſhort, that this impure <hi>Legis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> affecting an exteriour neatneſs, for the better hiding from the People the filth of his Mind, he commanded thoſe who had already embraced his errours, to have their foreskin cut, becauſe that it might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe detain ſome ordures, by which means a <hi>Mahometan</hi> preſenting himſelf to prayer, without being entirely purifyed, would not be heard of God. Who would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as a <hi>Mordar,</hi> that is to ſay, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving impure and Gullyed.</p>
               <p>This Circumſicion which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Shounet,</hi> is only a mark of their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the vocal Words of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who has not written it in his <hi>Alcoran;</hi> but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56668:37"/>it only afterwards, ſeeing he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny followers to diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who have the foreskin; and from the <hi>Jews</hi> who have it otherwiſe cut then they, tho' that their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion be received among the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>

               <p>Thoſe whom they Circumciſe muſt have attained to the Age of ſeven or eight years, never younger, but often much older. The day being appointed for the Ceremony, a Feaſt is prepared at the Houſe of the Perſon to be circumciſed. Who is dreſſed as fine as Hands can make him, and having ſet him upon a Horſe or Camel, they carry him all about the Town if it is ſmall, or only in his own Prince or Pariſh if it be great. His Scool-Fellows and Friends follow him all on Foot huzzaing and ſhouting the prayſes of their Friend, who is going to be liſted, in the number of the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> or true Believers.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56668:44"/>untill they well waſhed themſelves in the <hi>Bannio</hi> and performed the <hi>Abdeſt,</hi> they are not long adoing it; they do nothing more then plunge themſelves three times into the Water, than they go out and make Room for an other, who does the ſame and accordingly gives place to the next, and ſo one after another untill all the <hi>Turks</hi> whom the foregoing Night had obliged to this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony have purified themſelves after this manner.</p>
               <p>Tho' the number of thoſe who plunge themſelves into the purifying Ciſtern, be conſiderably great, becauſe that married Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom Marriage allows many things forbidden to others, are thereto obliged as well as thoſe who are not. Nevertheleſs they do not change the Water until It has ſerved them all, and that they have ſaid, plunging themſelves in itt, he uſual prayer of good <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> which is <hi>la illa illa la Allam dulilla, Alla heeber,</hi> or other ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Now the fourth and laſt Preparation for Prayer by the <hi>Turks,</hi> is the <hi>Abdeſt;</hi> they may do every where, nay and with herbs by Stones or Earth, when they are in any place, where there is no Water: they have got a fancy that God (who demends more the inſide than the outſide of Men) if they had
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56668:45"/>not firſt of all ſatisfied, at leaſt as much as they can that Ablution; nay, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in that impure State, they would be rather capable of drawing down the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God upon them, than obtain his Bleſſings, which they believe their <hi>Abdeſt</hi> does procure them. For this reaſon it is they never build <hi>Moſchs</hi> without adorning them with ſome Fountains; and when the Place is not convenient for that purpoſe. They hire a Man to keep Water in ſome Reſervatories, from which each Perſon draws by the means of ſome Cocks as much Water as is neceſſary for the ſatisfying this Abluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>It is to no purpoſe to ſay here after what manner the <hi>Turks</hi> perform this <hi>Abdeſt,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there be few People but know that the <hi>Turks</hi> waſh almoſt all their Head and Neck, the Arms to the Elbow, the Feet and extremity of the Channel through which the Urine runs and the Port by which a groſſer Excrement is vented: But perhaps the Reader will not be ſorry to learn that the ſtrict Obligation they have of waſhing themſelves ſo often, is extreamly painful and troubleſome for thoſe who are in the Countryes and far from Water, or who dwell in cold or more Northern Climates, nay, and that it is the Cauſe that ſeveral
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56668:45"/>of thoſe <hi>Turks</hi> could wiſh they were allowed to change their Religion, and embrace an other, that does bind them to ſo many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome waſhings.</p>
               <p>The fifth of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> waſhings is that which is called <hi>Eulu-iorkmaghi</hi> or mortuary cleanſing, which is waſhing the dead Coarſe, but as I think we have been padling long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, I ſhall Paſs on to give an account of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Juſtice. And indeed nothing can be more proper than to place here the Tribunal, next after the Religion and Church, their Judges being ever Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſons; whereby both orders joyned give orders to one another, and not only Reputation but maintenance; for theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Judicature are the only preferment of the Prieſthood; wherewith the Prieſt and Judge being maintained in the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, two Gaps are ſtopt with one Buſh without cauſing any part of the Land to lye dead in the hands of the Clergy, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impoveriſhing the People with Tythes. And this that Divine <hi>Legis-lator, Moſes</hi> ſeems to have foreſeen, and therefore made him unite the ſacred Rites, and Civil Sanctions into one Body, making the Law of the Land a piece of Gods Law, and the juſtice of the Magiſtrate Religion; which ſtamps no leſs Authority upon the Law, than it procures
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56668:46"/>Reverence to the Judges and promiſeth to the Government, where it is entertained, length of days and ſafety on the one Hand, with Riches and Honour on the other. Which courſe affords alſo ſuch Expedition as gives one ſide at leaſt, cauſe to applaud Juſtice. Whereas here the bettered Party is left ſo little to Boaſt of, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns home as ill ſatisfyed, as he who had Sentence pronounced againſt him.</p>
               <p>There are Divers orders of Judges; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially two; the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and over him the <hi>Moulacadi</hi> like a Lord Chief Juſtice; tho' as I have already ſaid the ſupreame Head of Judicature is the <hi>Mufti:</hi> Theſe Judges are all excepting the <hi>Mufti</hi> limited to ſet Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, and when convicted of Corruption they are made horrid Examples; the main points wherein <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Juſtice differs from that of other Nations are three; it is more ſevere, ſpeedy, and arbitraty; they hold the Foundation of all Empire to conſiſt in exact Obedience, and that in exemplary ſeverity; which is undeniable in all the World, but more notable in their State, made up of ſeveral People different in Blood, ſeat and Intereſt one from another, nor linct in affection, or any common engagement toward the Publick good, other than what meer terrour puts upon them. A ſoft Hand
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56668:46"/>were unaffectual upon ſuch a Subject, and would ſoon find it ſelf ſlighted, therefore the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Juſtice Curbs and Executes without either remorſe or reſpect; which ſucceeds better than ever did the <hi>Romans,</hi> with all their milder Arts of Civility; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Conqueſts with thoſe made by the <hi>Turk;</hi> you ſhall find his to continue quieta nd firme, theirs not ſecure for many Ages. Witneſs firſt <hi>Italy,</hi> than <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> always full of Rebellions, Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies and new Troubles, which were cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their Lenity, that did not humble the ſubdued as low as Prudence did require; And the <hi>Sultan</hi> has a great Iron Club ſet up in moſt Places of <hi>Turky,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Boſnia, Sclavonia, Hungary, Thrace</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to intimate what they are to truſt to; nor does he ſo much rely upon the Peoples Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which would tye him to reſpect full and leſs abſolute Domination, and then alſo be in their Power to alter, as upon that ſtrength which is in his own Hand makes him more himſelf, and binds with the tye of fear, whereto Humane Nature is ever enthralled. The ſecond point wherein their Juſtice excells is quick diſpatch; if the buiſneſs be preſent matter of Fact, then upon the leaſt complaint the partyes and Teſtimonyes are taken, and ſuddainly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56668:47"/>brought before the Judge, by certain Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaryes; and the cauſe is ever leſs than in two Hours diſpatched, Execution inſtantly performed, unleſs it appears a cauſe of ſuch moment as does allow of an appeal to the <hi>Moulacady,</hi> where alſo it is as ſpeedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided: If the matter be of Title or Right, the Partyes Name, the witneſſes, who ſhall forthwith be conſtrained to come in. For they have no old Deeds, nor other recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings beyond the memory of Man: In ſuch caſes Poſſeſſion and Modern Right carryes it, without that odious courſe of looking too far backward into the times paſt: this Expedition avoids confuſion and clears the Court; whereby it ſo becomes ſufficient for many Cauſes, and for a great People. Now as for the particular Perſon, tho he ſometimes ſeems diſſadvantaged by the haſt, which may make judgment raſh, yet that haſt not being paſſionate, it happens not often; nor then likely, is his dammage therein worſe, than with us, where after the ſuſpence, delay and Charge of ſuit, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight of a Lawyer, may with errour of pleading Caſt a good Cauſe; ſo that after a Man hath been miſerably detained to ſuch diſadvantages as his other affairs, as he had better have loſt his Suit at firſt; then doth it finally not ſo much on its own bare Right,

               <p>But before I proceed on the other Miniſters, I will ſay ſomething of the Origine of the Grandees of the Port. Thoſe who poſſeſs Places of truſt, whether in the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> or in the Empire (unleſs it be <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> of whom more hereafter) come all generally from Children taken in War, or ſent by way of Preſent from the <hi>Baſhawes;</hi> and Tribute Children, that are taken at the Age of Nine or Ten years out of the Arms of their Mothers in all the Provinces, ſubdued by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prince, they ought all to be of Chriſtian Parents; and without reckoning the Slaves taken from the Enemy, one may ſee by the Regiſters alone of the Demeſne of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that of both Sexes above twenty thouſand are brought thither every year. The leſſer <hi>Tartars</hi> who make continual Incurſions into all the Territories that are Enemies of the Empire ſend 'em in Great Numbers; and the Grand Seignior having the Choice of all theſe young Children, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt and the moſt promiſing are diſtributed into divers Serraglio's, to be inſtructed there in the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and in all ſorts of Exerciſes, that of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56668:50"/>
                  <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is filled with the flower of theſe laſt, and they are to be diſtinguiſhed into two Orders. The firſt and moſt honourable is that of the <hi>Ichog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans,</hi> deſtined for the great Charges of the Empire; the ſecond <hi>Azamoglans,</hi> employed in Offices which only requite ſtrength of Body. The <hi>Ichoglans,</hi> are thoſe in whom, beſides the Perfections of Body, their Governors have diſcovered a fine Genius, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a fine Education, and for the rendring them capable one day to ſerve their Prince. They are inſtructed with great Care and a very ſevere Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, they paſs through four Chambers called <hi>Oda,</hi> which are as four Claſſes, wherein they learn by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all that is ſuitable to Young Men, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to attend upon a great Prince, and who are as his Pages and his Gentlemen. If they commit the leaſt fault they are rigorouſly puniſhed, and a Man had need to be endued with great Patience to attain to the fourth <hi>Oda,</hi> where they begin to breath. But the hopes of coming to the greateſt Honours and moſt Eminent Offices, makes them ſuffer the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Treatment of the Eunuchs, who are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Maſters, and who are not ſparing to them of their Cudgels.

The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they keep there is ſo fine and exact in every thing, and ſo ſtrictly obſerved, that they live leſs like Souldiers than Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Monaſticks; and tho they be not forbidden Matrimony, yet very ſeldom do they marry. The great Priviledges which they enjoy throughout all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, where they are very much reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes many People to exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from paving Taxes, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves from ſome Publick Duties, to gain by money of the Officers,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56668:52"/>who protect them, and make them paſs for <hi>Janizaries:</hi> but they do not receive any Pay from the Prince; all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are limited to thoſe Priviledges, which are ſufficiently great. Thus by mingling the true <hi>Janizaries</hi> with the falſe, their Number does now amount to above a hundred thouſand; and to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only thoſe who are effectually <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries,</hi> their Body has rendred it ſelf ſo formidable, that they have unthroned <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchs, and made the face of the Empire change in a moment. The Power of their <hi>Aga</hi> is very great, and no Body can approach the Prince after the manner he is allowed to do; for, he can come into the Preſence of the <hi>Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> with his Arms free, and after a bold Gate and manner, whereas that all the Grandees of the Port without Exception, even the <hi>Grand Vizer,</hi> dare not appear there but with Arms acroſs, and their Hands upon one another on their Breaſt, for a ſign of a profound Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Beglerbeyes</hi> follow in Dignity the four principal <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> and are as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sovereigns in the general Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Empire, whereof the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> gives them the Command. Theſe <hi>Grand Baſhaws</hi> have under them <hi>Sangiac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys,</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56668:52"/>who are Governours of <hi>Sangiacs</hi> or particular Provinces, as the Sangiacbey of <hi>Salonica</hi> or of <hi>Morea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having mentioned theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers, and the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> I will proceed to give an account of the <hi>Spahees, Zaims,</hi> and <hi>Ghaoax</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spahees,</hi> who make a Body of about fifteen thouſand men, are a ſort of Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, who would paſs for the Nobility of the Country, and boaſt very much of their Bravery: they live upon certain <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marrits</hi> or <hi>Fewds</hi> given them by the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> for term of life, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for Services, but with an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſerve on Horſe-back well appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereſoever they ſhall be ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe <hi>Timarres</hi> cannot be taken from them unleſs they are wanting in their Duty, which is to be at the Army when the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> goes thither in Perſon. They live the moſt happy of all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and like petty So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns in the Places where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Zaims</hi> differ little from the <hi>Spahees,</hi> and enjoy, as well as they, the Command and Revenue of certain Fiefs given them by the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi> There is a great number of them throughout all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56668:53"/>and they eſteem themſelves as Lords &amp; Barons of the Country. The <hi>Zaims</hi> and the <hi>Spahis</hi> are they who compoſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and they know how many Horſes they are to furniſh accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Revenue of their <hi>Timars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Chaoux,</hi> or <hi>Chiaous</hi> Baſhaw, is the Head of all the Chaoux of the Empire, who carry the Commands of the Prince within and without the State, and are ſent upon Embaſſies, tho in the bottom they are only mere Meſſengers. Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Quality are commonly committed to their Keeping, and they never ſuffer them out of ſight.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal Offices and Dignities of the Empire, all poſſeſſed by People who are taken out of the Order of the <hi>Ichoglans.</hi> I now come to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> where the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> are poſſeſſed of the principal Places of Truſt.</p>
               <p>There be two Orders of the Eunuchs; there are thoſe who are white, who are meerly cut, and there are thoſe who are black, who are ſhaved even with the Belly. Both are ſevere, fantaſtical, and jealous, and uſe all thoſe cruelly who are under their Charge. There is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number of them both in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56668:53"/>and all the Empire, and generally through all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> where there is no private Perſon, in caſe he has but any Eſtate, but keeps an Eunuch or two as a Guard to his Wives. This it is that makes the great Trade of Eunuchs in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> and only in the Kingdom of <hi>Goleonda,</hi> a ſmall Territory in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> there has been known to be made in one Year two and twenty thouſand. In thoſe Parts moſt Fathers and Mothers who are poor, and have no kindneſs for their Children, whom they fear they ſhall not be able to provide Suſtenance for, if the leaſt ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Victuals ſhould happen, fell them to Merchants, who afterwards cauſe them to be cut, and ſometimes ſhaved ſheer off. Some of thoſe who have nothing left, when they are to make Water, are conſtrained to make uſe of a Quill or Tap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to carry it at the bottom of the Belly. As few recover from ſo dangerous an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it renders them much dearer than the others, and they are ſold in <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Turkey</hi> at the rare of ſix hundred Crowns a Man; a hundred, or a hundred and fifty, is the price of common Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs. Now for the furniſhing all <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> all <hi>Perſia,</hi> all the <hi>Indies,</hi> and all the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56668:54"/>Provinces of <hi>Africa,</hi> it is eaſie to judge that they muſt needs come by thouſands from diverſe Places. The Kingdom of <hi>Golconda</hi> in the <hi>Peninſula,</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Ganges,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Aſſan, Boutan, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> and <hi>Pegu</hi> beyond it, furniſh a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number of them. All theſe Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs are white and tawny. The black Eunuchs, who come from <hi>Africa</hi> in a far leſſer number, are, as I have ſaid, much dearer. The moſt deformed are thoſe which coſt the moſt, their extreme Ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs being a Beauty to them in their kind. A flat Noſe, a diſmal Look, a great Mouth, thick Lips, black Teeth and at a diſtance from one another, for commonly the <hi>Moors</hi> have fine Teeth, are Advantages for the Merchants who ſell them. The <hi>Serraglio</hi> of <hi>Conſtamino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> is filled with theſe two ſorts of <hi>Eunuchs.</hi> The black are appointed as a Guard to the Apartment of Women, and ſent to the Court by the Baſhaws of <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi> The white ſomething leſs ſavage, and who have been brought up with ſome Care, are for the Quarter of the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The four principal Eunuchs, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Perſon of the Prince, are the <hi>Hazodabachaio,</hi> the <hi>Chaſnardeerbaſhaw,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56668:54"/>the <hi>Kilargibaſhaw,</hi> and the <hi>Sarai Agaſi,</hi> who have over them the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> who is the Intendant of all the Chambers in chief of the <hi>Ichoglans:</hi> they commonly ſucceed one another; that is to ſay, the <hi>Sarai-Agaſi</hi> to the <hi>Kilargibaſhaw,</hi> he to <hi>Chaſnadarbaſhaw,</hi> this laſt to <hi>Hazodaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> and finally, the <hi>Hazodabachi</hi> to the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> who is ever the oldeſt in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the white Eunuchs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> or <hi>Capon Agaſi,</hi> is as the Lord High Steward of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> is the firſt in Dignity and in Credit of all the white Eunuchs, and is ever near the Perſon of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> be he where he will. He it is who introduces Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to the Audience; and all the great Affairs paſſing through his Hands to come to thoſe of the Prince, his Office renders him neceſſary to all the others, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him rich Preſents. All thoſe who make any to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> ought to addreſs themſelves alſo to the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> for the preſenting them to his Highneſs, from whence accrew to him very great Advantages. No Body can enter into the Apartment of the Emperour nor go out from thence without his Order: and when the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> has a Mind to ſpeak to him, he muſt be introduced by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56668:55"/>the <hi>Capi-Aga.</hi> Whether by Day or Night if any haſty Buſineſs does happen whereof the Vizier would give Notice to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> by Writing, the <hi>Capi Aga</hi> muſt receive it and return the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. He wears a Turbant in the <hi>Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> and goes every whereon Horſeback by a Priviledge particularly annexed to his Office. He accompanies the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> but ſtays at the Door, having no more Command in that Place. When he goes out of the <hi>Serraglio</hi> to quit his Office, which happens very ſeldom, he cannot be a Baſhaw. As concerning his Table, it is furniſhed at the Prince's Charge, and he has above ten <hi>Sultanins</hi> a Day, which is above five Pounds of our Money. <hi>Capigi Aga's</hi> have been known to have died two Millions rich, which returns into the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Coffers. This chief of the white Eunuchs is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with four others, who after him have the principal Places in the <hi>Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>'s Apartment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hazoda Baſhaw</hi> is as the Lord High Chamberlain, who has under his Charge the forty Pages of the Chamber, who commonly attend the <hi>Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>'s Perſon.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:56668:55"/>
               <p>The <hi>Serai-Agaſi</hi> has the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence General of all the Chambers of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Quarter, in what regards the Neatneſs, and the neceſſary Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He has an eye particularly upon the <hi>Seferli-Odaſi,</hi> which is the Chamber of the Pages, who take care of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Linnen, and who accompany him in his Voyages. He it is who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points their Cloaths, and all things they have occaſion for; and his Office is alſo much the ſame as in <hi>England</hi> the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſince it is for him gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to provide all that contributes to the neatneſs and good order of that great Palace. His Lieutenant is <hi>Seraihet-Odaſi,</hi> who is alſo an Eunuch, whoſe Office is to have the Tapiſtries changed every ſix Months, which are ſpread upon the floor in the Rooms and Chambers of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Haznadar,</hi> or <hi>Chaznadar-baſhaw,</hi> is the Head and Intendant of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and has the Conduct of the Pages of that Chamber. It is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Treaſury to be appointed to the neceſſities of State, and to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pay of the Souldiers, whereof the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> and the three <hi>Tef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56668:56"/>and Intendency: the Treaſury I now mean, is the Place where the Jewels of the Crown are kept, and all the other Riches heap'd up from Father unto Son by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes, But it is to be obſerved, that the <hi>Chaznadar-buſhaw</hi> has now but the Name of the Preſident of the Treaſury, nay, and that he has place therein, ſince that under the Reign of <hi>Sultan Amurat,</hi> the Pages having made their Complaints to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> of the ill Conduct of that Eunuch; upon their Requeſt he granted that the Chaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadar Baſhaw ſhould have no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand therein, and that the <hi>Charnaketo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſi</hi> ſhould thence forward exerciſe his Charge, without depriving him of the Title.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kilargibachi</hi> is the Head of the Pages of the <hi>Kilar,</hi> which is the place where all the exquiſite Drinks are kept for the Mouth of the Grand Seignior. He is moreover the Chief of all the <hi>Ake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi> who are the Cooks and Comfit-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, no Body being allowed to enter into thoſe Offices but by his Order; and he has under his Charge all the Plate which is for the Service of the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi> This Officer's Subſtitute is the <hi>Kilarketodaſi,</hi> upon quitting of his Charge.

If thoſe Perſons leave the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> before they are admitted into the Number of the forty Pages of the Chamber, they have but one Pay, whereas the higheſt mounts but to two hundred Aſpers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dogangibaſhi</hi> is the great Faulcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and his Place affords him much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon his Prince.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Hammangibaſhi</hi> is the Head and Intendant of the Baths.

It is in general to be noted, that when there is a remove of any one of the forty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Chamber, to fill their Places they take others out either of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, or the <hi>Kilar,</hi> or the <hi>Seferli,</hi> which is done in turns: they always take out the moſt ancient, and thoſe that are next ſucceeding in their Place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chimacibachi</hi> is the great Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or the Head of thoſe who whiten the <hi>Grand Seignior's</hi> Linnen.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Giritbey</hi> is the Head of thoſe who exerciſe themſelves in ſhooting with the Bow and lancing Darts; wherein a great Exerciſe is performed every Friday in a Place of the <hi>Serraglio</hi> appointed for that Divertiſement.

               <p>I do not doubt but that thoſe who have written of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have made mention of the Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Mecca,</hi> which is one of its eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Parts, wherefore I ſhall not enlarge farther upon that matter. I will only make three Remarks, taken out of an Original of one of the moſt Learned in the Rubricks of the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The firſt is, that by an ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Turks</hi> believe that <hi>Mecca</hi> is the Place where God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to build him an Houſe; that while he was there all Nations came to viſit him in Crowds; and that it is alſo the ſame Place where <hi>Mahomet</hi> received the <hi>Alcoran</hi> from Heaven. The ſecond regards the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands made to all the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> to go once in their Life time a Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca;</hi> for it is to be obſerved, that this Obligation does not extend to the poor People, who have nothing whereon abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to live, and who would make their Family ſuffer by their abſence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to leave them for their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56668:66"/>Maintenance. The third Remark is, touching the preference of the two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina.</hi> The firſt is the Place of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Birth, which he had a deſign to have honoured and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by this famous Pilgrimage, to which he obliges all thoſe of his Law The ſecond is the Place of the Sepulture of which they tell many Fables. <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> in his <hi>Alcoran</hi> only Orders the going to <hi>Mecca,</hi> where there are no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of this falſe Prophet than one of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However, this is allowed of by all hands, that they were a People of <hi>Scythia,</hi> who, either compelled by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or the Sword of their Neighbours, to abandon their own Countrey, paſſed through the Streights of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Mountains, and ſubdued and ſettled themſelves in <hi>Armenia</hi> the Greater; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon called <hi>Turcomania,</hi> as it is at this day.

Nevertheleſs, he would have conſtrained the <hi>Turk</hi> to have continued in his Service, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſo great a Breach, as that it came unto a Battel. <hi>Tangrolipix</hi> had the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, was by both Armies elected <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> conquered the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he added to his Dominions of <hi>Perſia.</hi> About this time did the <hi>Turk</hi> embrace the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, being two hundred and fourteen years after their Sally out of <hi>Scithia.

After the Death of <hi>Cutlu Muſes,</hi> his Son <hi>Solyman</hi> made a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous oppoſition againſt the Weſtern Chriſtians; after his Death, his Son <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> had a War, and then a Peace with <hi>Maſut</hi> Sultan of <hi>Iconium.</hi> This <hi>Maſut</hi> having gotten poſſeſſion of the whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Kingdom in that part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> at his Death divided it amongſt his three Sons. To <hi>Galizaſthan</hi> he gave the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal City of <hi>Iconium,</hi> with the under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; to <hi>Jagupaſan, A naſta</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evra,</hi> with part of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and the Territories adjacent: but to <hi>Daduns</hi> he gave the ample Cities of <hi>Caeſaria</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtia,</hi> and all the large Neighbouring Territories, being before part of the <hi>Greek,</hi> Empire. But theſe Brethren fell

But theſe laſt under <hi>Aladine</hi> one of the <hi>Selzuccian</hi> Family, joyning with the People of leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> took <hi>Cilicia</hi> from the <hi>Greeks</hi> with the Places bordering; firſt ſetling the Seat of their new Kingdom in <hi>Sebaſtia,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Iconium.

But the <hi>Venetians</hi> having notice of his Intentions, ſtood continually on their Guard; nevertheleſs he made a ſhift to repreſent his own Exploits in ſuch colours, that he cauſed the General of the Forces in <hi>Candia</hi>'s Head to be taken off that he might have his Place, which he accordingly obtained, as alſo that of the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> but ſoon after was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to reſign this latter to the Baſhaw of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> a ſtirring and active Man; who,

               <p>And now the <hi>Turks</hi> began to think again of proſecuting the War in <hi>Candia,</hi> of the total Subjection whereof the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier being extreamly ambitious, he made all poſſible Preparations and Proviſions for the carrying it on. Hereupon was an Engagement near <hi>Canca,</hi> with the loſs of many men on both ſides. But while the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> was making ready to come in Perſon to <hi>Candia</hi> with a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the <hi>Jews</hi> were grown mad all over
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56668:93"/>
                  <hi>Turkey</hi> with the belief that their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was now come, an Impoſtor called <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai</hi> giving himſelf out to be him; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they flocked together with ſo great a Concourſe, as that it was thought fitting to take the Ring-leaders into Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, and put them to Death. But the pretended <hi>Meſſiah, Sabatai Nevi,</hi> turned <hi>Mahometan</hi> to eſcape Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Now, in the Year 1667, does the Grand Vizier paſs over in Perſon into <hi>Candia,</hi> and having taken a view and ſurveyed all ſides of the City, he laid a formal and cloſe Siege to it. Now were Mines daily fired on both ſides, and Sallies as frequently made, to the great Slaughter of Men and the Deſtruction of their Works; and notwithſtanding that Winter came on, yet the <hi>Turks</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained Ground, continued the Siege tho the Extremity of the Seaſon put ſome Ceſſation to Action.</p>
               <p>The Year 1668 was uſhered in by a Fight at Sea, both to the Honour and Advantage of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> In the mean while the Marqueſs <hi>de Villa,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Candia,</hi> being recalled by his Sovereign the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he was ſucceeded, in that Command, by the Marqueſs <hi>de St. Andrew Montbrun,</hi> who

The <hi>Turks</hi> on the other ſide ſtormed three Baſtions at once, but were valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſſed by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and with great Slaughter.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Succours ſent by his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty arrived in <hi>Candy;</hi> whereupon, a general Sally was made, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> carried all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, untill that a Magizine of Powder, by chance taking Fire, it put them into Confuſion; inſomuch they

And now ſeeing that the Place was hardly any longer te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, they reſolved to return into <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding the earneſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to the contrary: Who being diſcouraged by their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the <hi>Turks</hi> animated, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of Capitulating with the <hi>Vizier:</hi> A Treaty was accordingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and the place delivered up on the 27th of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1669. and this after it had maintained the War from the year 1645.</p>
               <p>In the year 1670.

               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> ſpent his time wholly in Hunting, and in the Company of the <hi>Sultana,</hi> of whom having had a Son, he was ſo enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he could not be abſent from her in the leaſt, no more than ſhe from him.</p>

Many wondred that the Houſe of <hi>Serini,</hi> that had afforded ſuch Valiant Champions for Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhould Apoſtatize, and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Infidels. But the Neglects and Affronts undeſervedly caſt on <hi>Nicholas Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> during the late War, by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Imperial Court, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Scorn put on the <hi>Groatian</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> Nobility, was ſuppoſed to have fired the hot and ambitious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thoſe perſons, who could more eaſily endure the ſlavery of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> yoak, than condeſcend to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Prevalency of a contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hence was the ſource of the preſent War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which we will leave
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56668:95"/>for a while, to ſpeak of that which the <hi>Turks</hi> did meditate againſt <hi>Poland</hi> in 1672. it being requiſite for the Inteſtine Tranquillity of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, that they have always their forces em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a foreign War, and the <hi>Turks</hi> upon the more inclinable to one with <hi>Poland,</hi> both in regard of the ancient and inveterate Hatred they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt that Kingdom, through the valiant oppoſition and ſucceſsful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes it alwayes made againſt the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attempts or the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conduct of the Poliſh Ambaſſadour, then Reſident at the Port, between whoſe Miniſters and that Perſon was a great miſunderſtanding. Hereupon followed an Invaſion of <hi>Poland,</hi> in the year 1672, by the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> with an Army of an hundred and fifty thouſand men, and beginning his Enterprize with an Attach upon <hi>Caminieck,</hi> he had it, after eleven dayes, ſurrendred to him, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it had formerly been looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an impregnable Fortreſs. After which, the Turks extended their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts as far as they pleaſed, meeting with no oppoſition; the <hi>Poles</hi> being at Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among themſelves, finding there was no reſiſtſting this Torrent, concluded a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56668:96"/>Peace with the <hi>Ottomans</hi> upon theſe terms;</p>
               <p>That the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſhould quit all claim to <hi>

               <p>But the Year following the <hi>Poles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to pay their promiſed Tribute; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that if they were preſſed farther for it, they ſhould be forced to take up Arms in defence of their Honours, Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Privilege of their Dominions. This enraged the <hi>Turks</hi> to that degree, that Orders were immediately iſſued out, that all thoſe who eat the <hi>Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>'s Bread, ſhould, without farther delay, prepare themſelves for the War againſt <hi>Poland.</hi> Whereupon the Forces march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides; but notwithſtanding the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Menaces, the <hi>Poles</hi> under their General <hi>Sobieski,</hi> now King of <hi>Poland,</hi> fell upon the Turkiſh Camp, under the Command of <hi>Chuſalin,</hi> and other Baſhaws, kill'd to about twenty five thouſand of their men, with moſt of their Principal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Officers. The Booty too was very conſiderable; for beſides the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56668:96"/>Baggage, they took two thouſand Purſes of Money, then newly brought for the payment of the Souldiery, and twenty five thouſand Waggons of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Ammunition. Shortly after which, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> dying, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Sobieski</hi> was elected in his ſtead, and now reigneth:</p>
               <p>During theſe Occurrences, the <hi>Malteſe</hi> and <hi>Signioreſe Corſairs</hi> meeting with the <hi>Alexandria</hi> Fleet, they attacked them, and took four Gallions and two Saicks, being a Prize of ineſtimable value.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time the Malecontents in <hi>Hungary</hi> renewed their Petitions to the <hi>Turks</hi> for their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>As for Action, there was little paſſed, the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> dedicating the Year 1675 wholly to Mirth and Jollitry upon the account of the Circumciſion of his Son.

They are Gluttons, but the Gentry are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly perſons of great Humanity, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and Parts; but are nevertheleſs Ambitious and Popular, and cannot well brook a Monarchical Sway. Their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in Winter are cloſe-bodied Coats, with a looſe Cloak, button'd or clapp'd over their left ſhoulder, and under their right pap, ſo as that they have their right hand at liberty. They wear generally a girdle of what colour they pleaſe, folded about their middle. The Gentry affect moſt a Red Coloured Silk or Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet; the Citizens Red or Blue Cloath; and the Peaſants are commonly clad in a courſe Cloath, either of a Green, or one of the fore-mentioned Colours. The young men fancy the feathers of an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, Hawk, Kite or any other Bird of prey, a mighty ornament in their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. The <hi>Hungarian</hi> Women do now ſomething imitate the <hi>Germans,</hi> and other <hi>Europeans</hi> in their apparel, only they wear a ſhort Cloak or Mantle thrown over their ſhouldes, which they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, how often ſoever they change the mode of their other apparel: They generally wear a Veil over the Mouth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56668:102"/>and Noſe. The <hi>Hungarians</hi> ſhave their Heads, but wear their Beards to a great length; and this they do, thinking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thereby to render themſelves the more terrible to their Enemies. The <hi>Hungarians</hi> tell of one of their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had a Beard of that prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous length (in the Wars againſt the <hi>Turks</hi>) that it ſerved him for a Girdle by day, and at night inſtead of a Coverlid for his whole Body. And in the time of his ſervice, the whole Regiment being commanded to be ſhaved, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, proffering to lay down his life rather than part with this venerable ornament. Batchelours ſhave their Chins, but wear Muſtachoes on their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per lips.</p>

            <p>Before that Chriſtianity was planted in <hi>Hungary,</hi> theſe people, as moſt other Barbarous Nations, own'd no ſubjection to any certain Prince; but only by an unanimous conſent, ſubjected themſelves to the Government of a Ruler or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who was to direct and command the reſt, in the time of War or in other caſes extraordinary.

            <p>The <hi>Hungarian</hi> Nobility are Zealous Aſſertors of their Libertys, and the viledges that have been Anciently Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Monarchs.

            <p>The <hi>Hungarian</hi> Cavalry is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than their Infantty; which is chiefly to be aſcribed to the ſtrain of quick and nimble Horſes, which are bred in this Countrey.

The Foot, which they term <hi>Heydukes,</hi> Carry a ſhort Gun, little longer than a Horſeman's Carbine; on their Left Side hangs a Cimeter, and under their Arm a Battle-Ax. Antiently there was no other appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Devotion in theſe parts than this, they ſtick a Naked Sword in the Ground, and Pay that Worſhip to it, which they think is due to this Great

And though the Emperour <hi>Leopold,</hi> in the year 1608. called a Diet at <hi>Edenburg</hi> for the accommodating matters, yet the Malecontents were ſo perverſe, that the Aſſembly broke up, without coming to any concluſion. Hereupon Count <hi>Tecke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> ſeized upon ſeveral Fortreſſes on the <hi>Drave,</hi> and ſent to the Baſhaw of <hi>Buda,</hi> to advance with his forces, refuſing to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56668:109"/>have Peace with the Emperour, unleſs his own Propoſals was granted. Upon this, ſeventeen thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> and made great ſpoil, burning and deſolating all the Villages for the ſpace of fourteen miles, and were hardly reſtrained by the Baſſa himſelf from lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſte the Countrey. This growing thus worſe and worſe, the Emperour to reconcile matters, did by his Declaration promiſe all convenient liberty for the exerciſe of his Religion, with a <hi>Palatine,</hi> a Native of <hi>Hungary,</hi> with a general Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for what had paſſed. But Count <hi>Teckeley</hi> and other Malecontents, having other proſpects, all theſe reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions were rejected. Hereupon the Emperour cauſed a Detachment of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand Horſe and Foot to be made out of his Army then encamped on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to obſerve the motions of the <hi>French,</hi> and ſent them to joyn with Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> his Lieutenant General in <hi>Hungary:</hi> This Force conſtrained the Rebels to abandon ſeveral places they were poſſeſſed of. Nevertheleſs in the beginning of the year 1682. the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour diſpatched a Miniſter to Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> to treat of an accommodation upon his own terms; but the aſſurances
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56668:110"/>he had received from the Port, of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Protection, made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That he had no power to treat of himſelf, but muſt be forced to Act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Offen,</hi> and move ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the directions he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port.</p>
            <p>Thus the ſeaſon for Action coming, the Emperour ſent ſome Forces more for the better enabling Count <hi>Caprara</hi> to make head againſt the Enemy, which nevertheleſs were not conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to oppoſe the numerous Troops of the <hi>Turks,</hi> Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> and <hi>Abafti,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania.</hi> Neither were the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> ſtrength ſufficient to hinder them from acting ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or to prevent Count <hi>Teck ley</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging and taking of <hi>Chaſcaw,</hi> a ſtrong City near the <hi>Hewath;</hi> and <hi>Eſperies</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two days after. The Baſſa of <hi>Wara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> alſo beſieged <hi>Zathmar,</hi> which after ſeveral attacks, he carried by ſtorm. Hereupon Count <hi>Teckeley</hi> ſummoned the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Nobility to appear in Arms, though with ſmall reſort; forced the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> to abandon their Camp at <hi>Athol;</hi> which was followed with the ſurrender to him of <hi>Lewentz.

The Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne being now over, a Truce was concluded for two months between the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parties retired into their Winter Quarters.</p>
            <p>In the year 1683. the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> began the Campagne with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral skirmiſhes, and with various ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Count <hi>Wallaſtein,</hi> the Emperours Ambaſſadour at the Court of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſtruck up a League Offenſive and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive with that King, whereby he is bound to take the Field with between thirty and forty thouſand Horſe and Foot, to act Offenſively againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and Defenſively againſt all other Enemies to the <hi>German</hi> Empire; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of which, the Emperour binds himſelf to have an Army of ſixty thouſand men in readineſs upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; immediately to pay twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Florins, and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Queen Dowager of <hi>Poland</hi> diſclaim all pretenſions to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> and that neither Potentate enter into a Treaty of Peace with the <hi>Turks</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:56668:111"/>but with joint approbation. And that both Armies act ſeparate, unleſs <hi>Cracow</hi> or <hi>Vienna</hi> be beſieged, and then with united forces to fall upon the Enemy; and that the Czar of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> be invited into this alliance. Whereupon in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council of War held on the eighth of <hi>April</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> it was concluded, That the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſhould be <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo</hi> of all the forces on that ſide.

On the 24th of <hi>May</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> broke up with his Army, and marched towards <hi>Gran,</hi> with intention to fight the <hi>Tu ks</hi> there, but finding them too ſtrongly entrenched, he marched on, inveſted <hi>Newheuſ l,</hi> battering and ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with all the fury imaginable.
