            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But this ≈øeverity in the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Policy does not only extend to the <hi>Ba≈øhaws</hi> and great Men, but to the very <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family it ≈øelf, who are ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed with greater ≈øtrictne≈øs than all others, and are debarred all Wealth and Offices. Thus by the fundamental Laws of the Empire, the Children of a <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Daughter married to a <hi>Ba≈øhaw,</hi> are not capable of any Office in the State, but if by favour this is at any time di≈øpen≈øed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56668:6"/>with, they can never attain to any higher Preferment than that of a <hi>Capugiba≈øhee,</hi> which is one of the Porters of the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Gate. Nay, it is ≈øo great a Crime to be allyed to the Royal Family, that it is almo≈øt Trea≈øon in tho≈øe of this Race to name it, nor is there in <hi>Turky</hi> but one Branch of this Line of any account or e≈øteem, and that is the Off≈øpring of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> who was a Son of the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Si≈øter, and marryed to a <hi>Sultana</hi> (and are ≈øaid to be of the Race of the <hi>Tartars</hi>) thus coming only by the Womans ≈øide the le≈øs notice is taken of their Blood. Nor had this Family ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted to this day, had it not been for this extraordinary Prudence and Di≈øcretion of its conduct in all the Revolutions of the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Government, never a≈øpiring to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor medling with affaires of State, but living contentedly and with out O≈øtentation upon a ≈ømall yearly revenue of about 70000 Dollars.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> do look upon as one Cau≈øe of the Con≈øervation of their Dominions, their laying wa≈øt and de≈øolating their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces that lye the farthe≈øt remote from the Seat of their Empire, and by this means they think to enervate and di≈øpirit the People, and bring them more within the reach and compa≈øs of Authority. And indeed it is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56668:6"/>≈øeldom known that any Rebellions do ari≈øe under the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> ≈øway, tho' in the remote≈øt parts of <hi>A≈øia;</hi> and the≈øe few that have been ≈øeen, have with ca≈øe been calmed and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed for the Male-contents and re≈øtle≈øs Spirits find no ≈øhelter in tho≈øe Parts, being ≈øtripped of their Fortifications and Retreats in the Woods and Forre≈øts, and the Rebels thereby expo≈øed to the pur≈øuits of an irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Prince. And this it is that con≈øtrains the great men of that Empire to deliver them≈øelves up without more ado to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Puni≈øhment and Death at the Will of their Soveraign, ≈øeeing they have no means of flight, nor no place of refuge le≈øt in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that are laid wholly wa≈øt and afford no ≈øu≈øtenance or ≈øupport. Be≈øides this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling, di≈ømantling, and thus de≈øola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Country, is attended with this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage, that no Forreign Enemy can with a Land Army make any Inva≈øion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it with advantage, for the de≈øolation of it renders it uncapable of furni≈øhing any Provi≈øions, and that there it is ea≈øily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed by the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and for an Army to bring Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Provi≈øion along with it ≈øufficient for ≈øuch an Expedition, is a thing almo≈øt impo≈ø≈øible. Neverthele≈øs the immediate Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Places of their new Conque≈øts the <hi>Turks</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56668:7"/>take always Care to fortify, and to garni≈øh and ≈øtrengthen with Colonies of their own People.</p>
               <p>Now as the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Expeditions are like a Torrent, which bears all down before them ≈øo it is a point of their Policy when they have made a Conque≈øt of any con≈øiderable Country to ≈øtrike up a Peace immediately, that ≈øo they may have time to ≈øettle and confirm them≈øelves in their new Acqui≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, well knowing, that what they have ≈øo ha≈øtily overrun, is again to be as ea≈øily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and that the ≈øtream of ≈øuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations is as rapid in the Ebb as in the Flux.</p>
               <p>The frequent Change of Officers, the degrading of ≈øome and exalting of others, is thought to tend very much to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, for hereby tho≈øe Sparks are deprived of the means of rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them≈øelves in the Peoples Affections, or of fomenting any mutiny or alteration in the State: Be≈øides as all Offices are here purcha≈øed at very dear Rates, every <hi>Ba≈øhaw</hi> of <hi>Grand Caire</hi> or of <hi>Babylon</hi> paying three or four hundred thou≈øand Dollars for their Commi≈ø≈øion; others two, others one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thou≈øand, according as their places are more or le≈øs con≈øiderable, and this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they are con≈øtrained to take up at inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56668:7"/>paying forty or fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> annually and oftentimes more, ≈øo that they are forced to ≈øqueeze and fleece the People for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbur≈øing them≈øelves again, clear their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and bribe and purcha≈øe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Protection of the Minions of the Court. Neverthele≈øs this ≈øtands them in little ≈øtead, for when they have pretty well glutted them≈øelves with their Exorbitant Exactions, and that the People begin to bawle out loud again≈øt the Tyranny and Oppre≈ø≈øion of tho≈øe Mini≈øters, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently offered up a Sacrifice to their Furies, and tho≈øe va≈øt E≈øtates and Ma≈øs of Trea≈øure which they had ≈øo unju≈øtly heaped, confi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> u≈øe, who only be≈øtows on their Po≈øterity what he in his Bounty thinks fitting. Nor are the≈øe <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi> of Mini≈øters the only Per≈øons liable to the ≈øeverity of the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Government, tho≈øe who are the Favourites of the People being no le≈øs expo≈øed to the keenne≈øs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> ≈øway, which looks upon Popularity as an unpardonable Crime. But then the≈øe Darling Officers are not di≈øpatched into the other World after the ≈øame manner as tho≈øe publick Pe≈øts, who are executed in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, but the others are cajoled with all manner of fair treatment, the <hi>Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> Umbrage is di≈ø≈øembled and they perhaps

Thus does <hi>Turky</hi> afford the fruitful Landskip of the uncon≈øtancy and mutability of Humane Grandeur that ever any other Country did, one moment ≈øeeing one of the≈øe Meteors ≈øhining in all the ≈øplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, pomp, lu≈øtre and magnificence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and the next fall unpittied, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly put to death, his body thrown into the Dirt of a forreign and unknown Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, without any ≈øolemnity of Funeral or Monument, but no ≈øooner in the Grave than his memory is forgotten.</p>
               <p>But now I think 'twould not be all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improper to ≈øet down ≈øome of tho≈øe Religious Arts and Maximes whereby the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Faith has and is propogated, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ≈øince their Law has that influence upon Affairs of State, and ≈øo contrived for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profit of the Sovereign; but for that purpo≈øe I ≈øhall not need to look back ≈øo far as to give an account of its fir≈øt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king root or e≈øtabli≈øhment, nor that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> Law was an hodge-podg of <hi>Judai≈øme,

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56668:9"/>confe≈øs that he never ≈øinned) did a≈ø≈øume him into Heaven: when mi≈øt and ≈øought by the Souldiers in the throng, they laid hold of one of the Judges that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, who re≈øembled him much in favour and proportion, telling him that he ≈øhould not e≈øcape from them again; and ≈øo not believing what≈øoever he ≈øaid, executed him in his Room.

               <p>Toleration, as I ≈øaid, being one of the fir≈øt Traps that was laid for the Profe≈ø≈øours of others Creeds, they have improved it to this, among the other advantages of ≈øeducing and perverting the People that dwell among them, that as they allow of Churches and Hou≈øes of Devotion in places where they have been anciently founded, but admit not of holy buildings on new Foundations; they may repair the old coverings and roofs, but cannot lay a ≈øtone in a new Place con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Divine Service, nor if fire or any accident de≈øtroy the ≈øuper≈øtructure can it be re-edifyed, or any new ≈øtrength added to the Foundation, wherewith to underprop for an other building. Thus in time all the Churches in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire mu≈øt of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56668:10"/>nece≈ø≈øity fall to utter ruine, as many have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, ≈øo that ≈øeeing the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Laws do not permit <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Churches to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtored, <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> in time will be aboli≈øhed in tho≈øe Dominions, unle≈øs it be the good Will of Heaven otherwi≈øe to ordain it.</p>
               <p>Neither are their Laws concerning <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian</hi> Children le≈øs conducing to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Chri≈øtianity, for if a man turn <hi>Turk,</hi> his Children under the age of fourteen years, tho' educated with other Principles, mu≈øt be forced to the ≈øame Per≈øwa≈øion, Men that ≈øpeak again≈øt the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, that have ra≈øhly promi≈øed at a time of Di≈øtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Drunkenne≈øs to become <hi>Turks,</hi> orhave had a carnal knowledge of a <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, mu≈øt either become Martyrs or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates; be≈øides many other ≈øubtleties they have to entrap the Souls of <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> with the niceties and entanglements of their Law.</p>
               <p>Another point of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Policy is for the promoting of their Sect, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up any City Town or Fortre≈øs where <hi>Mo≈øques</hi> or other Religious Hou≈øes of their per≈øwa≈øion have been once built, and where <hi>Mahometani≈øm</hi> has been profe≈ø≈øed; thus the <hi>Turk</hi> has no ≈øooner ≈øet footing in a Town, but that he falls immediately to erecting of <hi>Mo≈øques</hi> and Temples, and thereby lays an

               <p>THe <hi>Turks</hi> are generally well complexio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, of goodly Statures, full Bodies, and ≈øutably proportioned; they ≈øuffer no hair about them, but a lock on their Crown, and what grows on their Faces; for their Beards they wear at full length, as a mark of gravity and of freedom, the Slaves in the <hi>Levant</hi> being ≈øhaved, and the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed who ≈øo un-man them≈øelves by taking off their Beards. It is a badge of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to wear white Sha≈øhes and Turbants on their Heads, and they di≈øtingui≈øh their Vocations and Quality by their foldings and their ≈øize. Next to their Skin they wear a Calico Smock, with large Sleeves longer than their Arms; under this a pair of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico Drawers, reaching to their Anckles, with Yellow or Red ≈ølip-Shoes, picked at the Toe, and plated on the Soal: Over all they wear a half ≈øleeved Coat girt unto them with a Sha≈øh or Towel: their Neck all bare; and this is their Summer Garb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Doors. But when they go abroad they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56668:13"/>wear over all Gownes, ≈øome with wide half Sleeves, others with long hanging Sleeves buttoned before, and by the meaner People another Fa≈øhion, reaching but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Knee, with hanging-Sleeves not much longer than the Arm, and open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but all of them ungathered in the Shoulders. In the Winter they wear a kind of Breeches or Drawers of Cloth which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ≈ømall of their Leg are ≈øowed to ≈øhort ≈ømooth Buskins of Leather without Soals, fit for the Foot, as the Glove for the Hand; lining their Gowns with Fur, as they do their Coats; having then the Sleeves (or quilted Wa≈øtecotes under them) reaching clo≈øe to their Wri≈øts. They wear no Gloves, they wear long Handkerchiefs at their Girdles, ≈øome of great Value, and admirable well wrought, the Modes never change in <hi>Turky,</hi> no more than they do in <hi>Spain,</hi> nor is there any great difference in the make of the Cloaths of mean People and tho≈øe of Quality, only that they wear Cloth of Ti≈ø≈øue, of Gold and Silver, Velvet, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Satin, Damask, Camlets, lined with Sables and other co≈øtly Furres, and with Martins, Squirrils, Foxes, and Coney-skins according to their ≈øeveral Qualities. But the common wear is Violet Cloth, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øtill the Antient cu≈øtome of pre≈øenting

The Clergy go much in Green, it being <hi>Mahomets</hi> Colour, and tho≈øe of his Po≈øterity and Kindred wear Green ≈øha≈øhes, and are called <hi>Emers,</hi> which is Lord, the Women in like manner wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring al≈øo ≈øomething of Green upon their Heads to be known. A <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to wear Green, if he does out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, he ≈øhall be ≈øoundly beaten, and his Cloaths torn off his Back. In the City they have no Arms, only tuck under their Girdle a crooked Knife of the bigne≈øs of a Dagger, in ≈øheaths of Mettal, all be≈øet with Gemms and precious Stones to a con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value. They are upright in their Gate, lofty in their Demeanour with an elated Countenance. The greate≈øt ≈øign of Love and Honour is among them to take a Per≈øon by the Hand, and lay it to ones Forehead; they lay their Hands on their Bo≈øomes in their familiar Salutations, bending their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a little; but in their re≈øpects to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of Illu≈øtrious Quality, they bow to the very Ground, and ki≈øs the Hem of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>Their Publick Buildings are va≈øt, and ≈øtately afar off being wonderfully beautifyed by the abundance of Trees planted among the Hou≈øes, ≈øo as each City ≈øeems rather a Wood than a City; which, be≈øide the plea≈øant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect, ≈øhelters again≈øt the Summer Sun and Winters Wind; the Streets are not broad, but paved with a high foot-Cau≈øay on each ≈øide, in the middle a pa≈ø≈øage for Carts and Hor≈øes; from the Caves on both ≈øides is made a Boarded Arch not very clo≈øe, yet

               <p>But as I have ≈øpoke ≈øomething of their Diet and their Habitations, it will not be impertinent to enlarge a little farther upon their Hou≈øe-keepings and Habitations; the <hi>Turks</hi> find the advantage of their ≈øparing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour both in War and at home, the greate≈øt Provi≈øions that are carryed into their Camp being only of Rice, potted Butter, and ≈øome dry or poudred Meats, they do not bu≈øy a va≈øt number of Men to ≈øearch after and procure a hundred ≈øorts of different Meats, nor oblige their Souldiers to wander from their main Body to fetch away to the peril of their lives wherewith to ≈øatisfy their Intemperance. And as for their Hou≈øe keeping a Barrel of Rice a year, with ≈øome Pots of Butter, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56668:17"/>dryed Fruits, make the greate≈øt <hi>Provi≈øions</hi> of a very numerous Family. For my part I can refer to no other Cau≈øe than this the ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety the ≈øtrength and plumpne≈øs of all the Ea≈øtern-People: And if they were allowed to have great E≈øtates in Property for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Annual Rents, this Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Moderation they have ≈øo long made in their Diet, would have ≈øetled more Rich Families in <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> than Fea≈øting and Luxury have ruined in all his Maje≈øties three Kingdomes.

               <p>Their Attendants at the Table are Slaves, ≈øuch as have been be≈øtowed upon them by way of Pre≈øent, or which they have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in War or by their Money; and the greater number a Man has, the richer he is accounted: They make three Meals a day. But at a Fea≈øt they be≈øiege the Table all the day long, unle≈øs they ri≈øe to ea≈øe Nature and forthwith return. They abominate Hogs-Fle≈øh, Blood, and whatever hath dyed of

As Wine is prohibited them by their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> (wherein neverthele≈øs they will debauch to a high Degree in private) their u≈øual Drink is pure Water and ≈øundry ≈øorts of <hi>Sherbets,</hi> ≈øome made of Sugar and Lemmons, ≈øome of Violets, Peaches, Apricocks, or other Flowers, Fruits or Plumbs, as is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of each Province; the≈øe are dryed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a con≈øi≈øtence rea≈øonable hard, and portable for their u≈øe in War, or el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, mingling about a ≈øpoonful with a Quart of Water. But one of their mo≈øt common Drinks, now in great reque≈øt with us, is their <hi>Coffee,</hi> and Coffee-Hou≈øes abound in <hi>Turky</hi> more than Taverns nay Inns or Ale-Hou≈øes in <hi>England.</hi> In their <hi>Coffee-Hou≈øes</hi> upon Scaffolds half a yard High, which they call <hi>Sofats,</hi> covered with Mats, they ≈øit cro≈øs-leg'd after the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> manner, commonly two or three hundred together chatting, often having ≈øome ≈øorry Mu≈øick, thrumming up and down the Room all the while.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56668:18"/>which is to be a≈øcribed to Polygamy, which renders the Husband unfit for ≈øufficient cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øpondence, and ≈øu≈øpicious the Women will ≈øeek for due Benevolence el≈øewhere. Now they are generally exhorted to Matrimony for the propagating of their Law, and the Man lo≈øes his Reputation who deferreth marrying till the Age of five and twenty. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man is allowed four Wives, who mu≈øt all pin their Faith upon <hi>Mahomets</hi> Sleeves, and as many Concubines as he can keep, and that two of any Religion ≈øoever. Yet this ≈øet number of their Wives is no point of their Religion, but a re≈øtriction introduced upon ≈øome Politick Con≈øideration, as too great a Burden and debilitation to mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates and Bodies. A Man being bound to make each Wife a Cabin or Dowry, and each by the Law is allowed to claim her ≈øhare in the conjugal allowance, at lea≈øt one night in the Week; for if any of them hath been neglected for a whole Week before, ≈øhe may challenge <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> night as her due, and the Law hath provided her Remedy in that ca≈øe again≈øt her Husband: But if her mode≈øty will not allow her to ≈øue for one Weeks Default, ≈øhe has neverthele≈øs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity to contrive a ≈øupply of her wants. Now as the Women in <hi>Turky</hi> are kept in the highe≈øt re≈øtraint imaginable, not being

Now having bought their Wife of her Parents, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the contract before the <hi>Cadi</hi> they ≈øolemnize their marriage in this manner. Many Women are invited by the Mother of the Bride to accompany her the night before the Marriage day, whereof they ≈øpend a great part in fea≈øting; then lead they her
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56668:19"/>into a Bath, where they anoint and bath her. So breaking company, they depart unto their ≈øeveral Re≈øts, and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning return unto her Chamber; where they deck her in her riche≈øt Ornaments, tying on her Silcken Buskins with Knots not ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknit. The Bridegroom having fea≈øted a number in like manner, in the morning they al≈øo repair to his Hou≈øe in their be≈øt Trappings, and nobly mounted, from whence they ≈øet forward two and two in a Rank, to fetch home the Bride, accompanyed with Mu≈øick, and conducted by the <hi>Sagdich,</hi> who is the neare≈øt of his Kindred. To the <hi>Sag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dich</hi> the Bride is delivered with her Face clo≈øe covered, and then ≈øhe is ≈øet a≈øtride on Hor≈øe-back, with a Canopy carryed over her in ≈øuch manner, as no part of her is to be di≈øcerned. Thus does this Troup re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in the ≈øame order that it came, having their Pre≈øents and Apparel carryed after them in <hi>Serbets</hi> or a kind of Baskets, and then follows the Bride her ≈øelf, and la≈øt of all her Slaves if any have been given her. The Bridegroom ≈øtandeth at his Door to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, and has all re≈øpects paid him by his Gue≈øts: who neverthele≈øs go not in, and is regated by them with ≈øeveral Pre≈øents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure.

               <p>A great means as I have already ≈øaid, of <hi>Mohometi≈ømes</hi> making that Progre≈øs in the World, is its plea≈øing Doctrine, ≈øuited to the depraved Inclinations of Mankind, it being ≈øaid in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> that when their Prophet asked the Angel concerning <hi>Venery</hi> and ≈øome other delicacyes of life, he told him; that God did not give Man ≈øuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, to have them fru≈øtrate but enjoyed, as made for the Gu≈øt of Man, not his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein his Creatour delights not, upon this it is, and for the drawing in Luxurious Complexions, which perhaps are the greate≈øt part of Mankind, that the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> permits <hi>Poligamy</hi> to make a numerous People, which is the Foundation of all great Empires; and prohibits <hi>Wine,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Devil in every Grape; thereby har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening the Souldier, preventing di≈øorder, and facillitating publick Provi≈øion.

               <p>Having ≈øpoke ≈øo much of the Religion it ≈øelf, it is now convenient to ≈øay ≈øomething of the manner of its Exerci≈øe, which is this in ≈øhort; every <hi>Mo≈øque</hi> has a high ≈ølender
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56668:34"/>Spyre Steeple adjoyning: on the out≈øide whereof and high, is made abound or Tower with a Door opening <hi>South-Ea≈øt</hi> or <hi>Ea≈øt,</hi> as the Countrye lyes towards <hi>Meccha;</hi> here the Prie≈øt or <hi>Muazzin</hi> entring, with his Hands bowed over his Ears walking round, turning on the Right Hand, in a loud voice tells the People, many times over that there is but one God, which having performed, all tho≈øe that are piou≈øly given, throng to the <hi>Mo≈øque,</hi> and ≈øay their Prayers, continually repeating <hi>Allah heeber,</hi> as al≈øo the profe≈ø≈øion of their Faith, and then they ≈øay <hi>Ahia Elfela, Ahia Elfela,</hi> which ≈øignifies come away to prayers, I give you fair notice. Their ge≈øtures are fir≈øt ≈øitting cro≈øs legg'd, wafting of the Body, then pro≈øtrate twice on their Face, they ki≈øs the Earth; afterward they ri≈øe, and ≈øtand with their Hand bowed over their Ears, but never do they kneel or uncover their Head, accounting tho≈øe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtures un≈øeeming. Having already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned how often this ≈øervice is performed, It is fitting that I in≈øert, that they believe that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> not having obeyed the Command they had received from God, of praying to him often, he ordered <hi>Mahomet</hi> to pre≈øcribe to the <hi>Mu≈ø≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56668:35"/>that they ≈øhould addre≈øs to him fifty times a day their Vows and Prayers, but he fore≈øeeing that his followers could not well acquit them≈øelves of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he prevailed ≈øo far with God that he contented him≈øelf with the tenth part of the Homages, that he meant to have had paid him, and that this great number of fifty prayers a day, was reduced to five, now the la≈øt and fir≈øt Service which is at day break and an Hour after Sun≈øet makes a fine Show, all the <hi>Mo≈øques</hi> being hung full of burning Lamps; but none are bound to this frequency of prayer, but ≈øuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons as have lei≈øure, others making the High-way or their Hou≈øes ≈øerve the turn, and this was devi≈øed to keep Religion from falling into the danger of oblivion, which is in no wi≈øe better maintain'd than by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often called to mind. Their Sabbath is kept on the <hi>Friday,</hi> tho' not ob≈øerved with all the ≈øtrictne≈øs that <hi>Sundays</hi> are or ought to be among≈øt us. Moreover they have two ≈øolemn times: <hi>Bairam</hi> and <hi>Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi> they are both Lents, the fir≈øt la≈øts three days, the other a month: their Fa≈øt is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> manner, not in quantity or quality of Meats, but in time; for all the day long, they may neither eat, drink, nor u≈øe any ≈øort of venery; but at

Be≈øides the <hi>Turks</hi> have one piece of Divinity peculiar to them≈øelves, which is a Cu≈øtome of their Prie≈øts to ≈øell their merit; ≈øome more, ≈øome le≈øs, according to the Sanctimony of the Seller. But before I clo≈øe up this Article of Religion, I will ≈øet down what things a <hi>Turk</hi> is bound to do before prayers, which may be reduced to five. The fir≈øt, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Articles of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Faith. The ≈øecond, to be Circumcized. The third, to pardon ones Enemyes. The fourth, is to call out at the Turret of the Church Steeples, or to go to the Mo≈øque when one is called thither. And the fifth, is to wa≈øh ones ≈øelf, which is the immediate Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prayer. Now all the Articles of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Faith may be reduced to two, namely that there is one God, and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his Prophet or me≈ø≈øenger, and that that only God is the Creatour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of Earth, and ab≈øolute Ma≈øter of all things. For which rea≈øon they do not ≈øuffer in their <hi>Mo≈øques</hi> any Image repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any living thing, either in relief or meer painting. The ≈øecond Article of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Faith comprehends an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the mad fancyes and extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56668:36"/>of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and of all its Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatours, believing that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is the Me≈ø≈øenger of God, and that there cannot be a more certain truth, than all that this Impo≈øtour has left them either in Writing or Tradition. This Article being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all the re≈øt, it is not nece≈ø≈øary that I hear in≈øert all their ≈øilly fancies of the Creation of the World, of its Pre≈øervation, and of the cour≈øe God takes to ≈øanctify and ≈øave it; nor ≈øhall I ≈øpeak of all their whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øycal Opinions and ≈øo little conformable to right rea≈øon with which they fill their Minds and ≈øtuff their Books. Enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready has been ≈øaid of their Paradice which they make all Spiritual by the beatifick Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of God, and all brutal by a glut of all ≈øen≈øual plea≈øures, and their affording Roome there to ≈øeveral Brute Animals. Nor ≈øhall I ≈øo much as touch upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons whom they admit into the Li≈øt of their Prophets, the number being too great, and who may all be reduced to the≈øe three, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Who≈øe Divine Filiation and Death upon the Cro≈øs they deny, and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whom they believe to be the greate≈øt of all. But will fall to give ≈øome account of their Circumci≈øion, and their manner of performing it. Being often hindred by a <hi>Phimo≈øis</hi> from ≈øatisfying his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56668:36"/>Brutalities, had his fore skin cut, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that all his followers ≈øhould cau≈øe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to be circumci≈øed, that ≈øo the Bodyes of his <hi>Mu≈ø≈øulmans</hi> might again be known that were killed in the Battells, they ≈øhould fight for the e≈øtabli≈øhment of his Law, that ≈øo they might be interred and Honoured as Martyres, whether it was for the more drawing in the <hi>Jews</hi> to follow his errours by the re≈øemblance of that Ceremony, which only differs from theirs in that having cut the fore skin, they do not tear like them, with the Naile a little of the Fle≈øh, which is above what the <hi>Anotami≈øts</hi> call the Curb, whether in ≈øhort, that this impure <hi>Legis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> affecting an exteriour neatne≈øs, for the better hiding from the People the filth of his Mind, he commanded tho≈øe who had already embraced his errours, to have their foreskin cut, becau≈øe that it might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe detain ≈øome ordures, by which means a <hi>Mahometan</hi> pre≈øenting him≈øelf to prayer, without being entirely purifyed, would not be heard of God. Who would con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as a <hi>Mordar,</hi> that is to ≈øay, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving impure and Gullyed.</p>
               <p>This Circum≈øicion which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Shounet,</hi> is only a mark of their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the vocal Words of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who has not written it in his <hi>Alcoran;</hi> but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56668:37"/>it only afterwards, ≈øeeing he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny followers to di≈øtingui≈øh them from the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> who have the foreskin; and from the <hi>Jews</hi> who have it otherwi≈øe cut then they, tho' that their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion be received among the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Zaims</hi> differ little from the <hi>Spahees,</hi> and enjoy, as well as they, the Command and Revenue of certain Fiefs given them by the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi> There is a great number of them throughout all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56668:53"/>and they e≈øteem them≈øelves as Lords &amp; Barons of the Country.

               <p>The <hi>Chaoux,</hi> or <hi>Chiaous</hi> Ba≈øhaw, is the Head of all the Chaoux of the Empire, who carry the Commands of the Prince within and without the State, and are ≈øent upon Emba≈ø≈øies, tho in the bottom they are only mere Me≈ø≈øengers. Pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Quality are commonly committed to their Keeping, and they never ≈øuffer them out of ≈øight.</p>
               <p>The≈øe are the principal Offices and Dignities of the Empire, all po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by People who are taken out of the Order of the <hi>Ichoglans.</hi> I now come to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> where the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> are po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the principal Places of Tru≈øt.</p>
               <p>There be two Orders of the Eunuchs; there are tho≈øe who are white, who are meerly cut, and there are tho≈øe who are black, who are ≈øhaved even with the Belly. Both are ≈øevere, fanta≈øtical, and jealous, and u≈øe all tho≈øe cruelly who are under their Charge. There is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number of them both in <hi>Con≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56668:53"/>and all the Empire, and generally through all the <hi>Ea≈øt,</hi> where there is no private Per≈øon, in ca≈øe he has but any E≈øtate, but keeps an Eunuch or two as a Guard to his Wives. This it is that makes the great Trade of Eunuchs in ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of <hi>A≈øa</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> and only in the Kingdom of <hi>Goleonda,</hi> a ≈ømall Territory in the <hi>Ea≈øt-Indies,</hi> there has been known to be made in one Year two and twenty thou≈øand. In tho≈øe Parts mo≈øt Fathers and Mothers who are poor, and have no kindne≈øs for their Children, whom they fear they ≈øhall not be able to provide Su≈øtenance for, if the lea≈øt ≈øcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Victuals ≈øhould happen, fell them to Merchants, who afterwards cau≈øe them to be cut, and ≈øometimes ≈øhaved ≈øheer off. Some of tho≈øe who have nothing left, when they are to make Water, are con≈øtrained to make u≈øe of a Quill or Tap<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and to carry it at the bottom of the Belly. As few recover from ≈øo dangerous an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it renders them much dearer than the others, and they are ≈øold in <hi>Per≈øia</hi> and <hi>Turkey</hi> at the rare of ≈øix hundred Crowns a Man; a hundred, or a hundred and fifty, is the price of common Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs. Now for the furni≈øhing all <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> all <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> all the <hi>Indies,</hi> and all the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56668:54"/>Provinces of <hi>Africa,</hi> it is ea≈øie to judge that they mu≈øt needs come by thou≈øands from diver≈øe Places. The Kingdom of <hi>Golconda</hi> in the <hi>Penin≈øula,</hi> on this ≈øide the <hi>Ganges,</hi> and tho≈øe of <hi>A≈ø≈øan, Boutan, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> and <hi>Pegu</hi> beyond it, furni≈øh a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number of them. All the≈øe Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs are white and tawny. The black Eunuchs, who come from <hi>Africa</hi> in a far le≈ø≈øer number, are, as I have ≈øaid, much dearer. The mo≈øt deformed are tho≈øe which co≈øt the mo≈øt, their extreme Ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs being a Beauty to them in their kind. A flat No≈øe, a di≈ømal Look, a great Mouth, thick Lips, black Teeth and at a di≈øtance from one another, for commonly the <hi>Moors</hi> have fine Teeth, are Advantages for the Merchants who ≈øell them. The <hi>Serraglio</hi> of <hi>Con≈øtamino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> is filled with the≈øe two ≈øorts of <hi>Eunuchs.</hi> The black are appointed as a Guard to the Apartment of Women, and ≈øent to the Court by the Ba≈øhaws of <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi> The white ≈øomething le≈øs ≈øavage, and who have been brought up with ≈øome Care, are for the Quarter of the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi>

               <p>The four principal Eunuchs, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Per≈øon of the Prince, are the <hi>Hazodabachaio,</hi> the <hi>Cha≈ønardeerba≈øhaw,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> or <hi>Capon Aga≈øi,</hi> is as the Lord High Steward of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> is the fir≈øt in Dignity and in Credit of all the white Eunuchs, and is ever near the Per≈øon of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> be he where he will.

No Body can enter into the Apartment of the Emperour nor go out from thence without his Order: and when the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> has a Mind to ≈øpeak to him, he mu≈øt be introduced by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56668:55"/>the <hi>Capi-Aga.</hi> Whether by Day or Night if any ha≈øty Bu≈øine≈øs does happen whereof the Vizier would give Notice to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> by Writing, the <hi>Capi Aga</hi> mu≈øt receive it and return the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer. He wears a Turbant in the <hi>Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> and goes every whereon Hor≈øeback by a Priviledge particularly annexed to his Office. He accompanies the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> but ≈øtays at the Door, having no more Command in that Place. When he goes out of the <hi>Serraglio</hi> to quit his Office, which happens very ≈øeldom, he cannot be a Ba≈øhaw. As concerning his Table, it is furni≈øhed at the Prince's Charge, and he has above ten <hi>Sultanins</hi> a Day, which is above five Pounds of our Money. <hi>Capigi Aga's</hi> have been known to have died two Millions rich, which returns into the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Coffers.

               <p>I do not doubt but that tho≈øe who have written of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have made mention of the Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Mecca,</hi> which is one of its e≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Parts, wherefore I ≈øhall not enlarge farther upon that matter. I will only make three Remarks, taken out of an Original of one of the mo≈øt Learned in the Rubricks of the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The fir≈øt is, that by an ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Turks</hi> believe that <hi>Mecca</hi> is the Place where God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to build him an Hou≈øe; that while he was there all Nations came to vi≈øit him in Crowds; and that it is al≈øo the ≈øame Place where <hi>Mahomet</hi> received the <hi>Alcoran</hi> from Heaven. The ≈øecond regards the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands made to all the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> to go once in their Life time a Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca;</hi> for it is to be ob≈øerved, that this Obligation does not extend to the poor People, who have nothing whereon ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to live, and who would make their Family ≈øuffer by their ab≈øence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to leave them for their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56668:66"/>Maintenance. The third Remark is, touching the preference of the two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina.</hi> The fir≈øt is the Place of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Birth, which he had a de≈øign to have honoured and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by this famous Pilgrimage, to which he obliges all tho≈øe of his Law The ≈øecond is the Place of the Sepulture of which they tell many Fables. <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> in his <hi>Alcoran</hi> only Orders the going to <hi>Mecca,</hi> where there are no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of this fal≈øe Prophet than one of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though the Emperour <hi>Leopold,</hi> in the year 1608. called a Diet at <hi>Edenburg</hi> for the accommodating matters, yet the Malecontents were ≈øo perver≈øe, that the A≈ø≈øembly broke up, without coming to any conclu≈øion. Hereupon Count <hi>Tecke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> ≈øeized upon ≈øeveral Fortre≈ø≈øes on the <hi>Drave,</hi> and ≈øent to the Ba≈øhaw of <hi>Buda,</hi> to advance with his forces, refu≈øing to

Hereupon the Emperour cau≈øed a Detachment of ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thou≈øand Hor≈øe and Foot to be made out of his Army then encamped on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to ob≈øerve the motions of the <hi>French,</hi> and ≈øent them to joyn with Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> his Lieutenant General in <hi>Hungary:</hi> This Force con≈øtrained the Rebels to abandon ≈øeveral places they were po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of. Neverthele≈øs in the beginning of the year 1682. the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour di≈øpatched a Mini≈øter to Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> to treat of an accommodation upon his own terms; but the a≈ø≈øurances
